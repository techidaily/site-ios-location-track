Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely.

## Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?

Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.

But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.
