Why monitor cell phone activity? This question crosses the mind of every parent at some point or the other. Parental control and phone spy tools make it easy for parents to monitor phone activities and ensure children’s safety at all times. Parents are aware of where their kid is, who he/she is with, their actions, and their social media interactions, which are important inputs for parents to analyze their kid’s behavior and whether or not their child is in a safe company.

Also, if your child is out late and doesn’t make it home on time, parents can keep an eye on the location of the kids and be rest assured that they are not in danger.

Moving on, we all know that the internet/web is a blessing for this generation, but if misused, it can have catastrophic results. Children often fall prey to websites, online games, etc. that deviate their attention from studies and drive them to indulge in hazardous activities.

To protect your child’s future and know for sure that he/she is using their cell phone and the internet for productive uses only, it is important for parents to monitor phone activity regularly. To do so, many phone spy software and parental control apps are available. These tools work as browser trackers, call logs/messages trackers, real-time location trackers, Social media hacks, etc.

Given below are two great software to monitor cell phone activity easily. Give them a good read and use them to monitor phone activity on Android/iPhone.
