## How to Track Apple iPhone SE by Phone Number

In most cases, tracking a lost iPhone has always been made possible thanks to the presence of tracking apps, and the use of the IMEI number. However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.

## Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?

A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone SE, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone SE via a number that is no longer available. However, there's a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.

You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone SE in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone SE, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.

## Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy

Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone SE from whoever has the phone. In this case, the application of [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) would be highly recommended. The mSpy program is a highly versatile program that can be used to perform various functions depending on the preferences of the user. In our case at hand, you can use this program to track your Apple iPhone SE regardless of what part of the world the phone could have been taken to or located.

**TIP:** Please note that you can only track down your Apple iPhone SE using mSpy by first installing the app on your phone. Without the installation process, tracking your phone using mSpy will be close to impossible.

The following is a detailed process on how to track an iPhone by number using mSpy phone locating feature.

Tracking a lost phone can be fun and at the same time a daunting task. The outcome or the general experience of tracking a lost phone will solely depend on the methods applied in the overall process. As we have seen in this article, though many people may argue that it is possible to track an iPhone by the number it is evident that the overall process can be problematic and in most cases, impossible. The only way out of tracking and finding your phone is by using the IMEI number. Any other number used for iPhone tracking purposes will only be for gathering information for investigative reasons.
