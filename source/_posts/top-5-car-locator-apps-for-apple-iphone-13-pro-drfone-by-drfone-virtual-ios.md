## Part 6: Frequently Asked Questions

When it comes to **WhatsApp tracking**, you may have some questions. Here are the answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding this topic from the internet:

1. **How do I export WhatsApp chats to legal documents?**

To export WhatsApp chats to legal documents, you need to open WhatsApp on your device. Now locate the conversation you want to export and tap the three-dots option from the top right corner. From the ensuing menu options, select "More" and press “Export Chat.” You will be presented with options to include or exclude media in the export. Select the desired option to export the chat.

2. **Can I track WhatsApp messages on someone else's device without physical access?**

No, tracking WhatsApp messages on someone else's device requires physical access to that device. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted for all users. This means that they are only accessible on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device where the account was registered. To track someone's WhatsApp messages, you would generally need to install monitoring software. Along with that, you should gain physical access to their device to set up monitoring tools.

3. **Can I track WhatsApp messages if they are backed up on iCloud?**

WhatsApp provides users with the option to back up their chat history to iCloud. While these backups can help restore chats, they are not designed for real-time tracking purposes. To access the conversations in the backup files, you will need to use a tool or service with decryption capabilities. It is due to the fact that WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, tracking WhatsApp messages can be helpful in various scenarios. These scenarios range from monitoring your conversations to ensuring the safety of loved ones.

## Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak

The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.

For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.

Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.

Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device.

Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.

Step 4: You can then log in to your [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device.

## Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak

Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.

Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg)

Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.

Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.

Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the

device will however make it easier for the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.
