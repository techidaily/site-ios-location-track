When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.

## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with ease.

You also need to know how to stop Google from tracking your Android phone. This feature can be used to track your device through other apps.

- Now check your accounts until you find the "Google Account" option
- Tap on it and then scroll down to the "Manage Your Data & Personalization" option and tap on it
- You will find "Activity Controls" where you can pause or turn off the service altogether.

Google Location Sharing. This will turn off location sharing if you use it to connect with friends and family.

### 3) Nord VPN

Nord VPN is a great tool to fake your GPS location and stop people from tracking your phone. It works by masking your true IP address and then using servers in another location to fake your position. This tool is great for stopping people from tracking you using browser-based apps. It also does affect the GPS chip and stop it from transmitting your true location. Nord VPN has servers in countries all over the world, which means you can move your location to another continent to fool those who may be tracking you.

## Part 1: How does the parent tracking tool work?

Many ways are used by the tracking tools to make sure that the children are always monitored. Some of the features include geo-fencing, app tracking, location, movements, and remote device locking. The page contents are also analyzed rather than database filtering to make sure that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices get in remote control of the parents.

The other implementations that will be applied by such applications are keyword profanity and remote content locking as well. The two-factor authentication will also get more control to the parents and will allow them to capture the activities of the child with ease. If you want to know how to prevent the police from tracking your phone then it is advised to read this article thoroughly to get the best ideas.

## 1.1 Some apps that Parents use for Tracking and how these Work?

- **Qustodio –** It is one of the apps that is mostly used for tracking. The devices that are configured with it are Ma, iOS, and Android.
- **Kaspersky –** It comes with a premium price and creates a geo fencing which would not allow the child to browse freely. The activities are continuously monitored.
- **Circle Home Plus –** It monitors the home as well as the remote network that your child is using. The best thing is that it does not let your child know about the monitoring.
- **Net Nanny –** This is an application that parents use to monitor the child with web filters, screen recording, and app blocking features. It’s a bit pricy with all the features included.

### 1.2 Why Should We Prevent Parents from Tracking?

If you want to know how to stop your phone from being tracked by parents then it is important to know the reasons. If I consider myself as a child then I don’t think that I would like this idea one bit. Now, why should I prevent the parents from reaching out to My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max remotely?

- The children must feel that the parents trust them in full and they must not be a prying eye at all.
- Everyone has its privacy and it doesn’t feel good to meddle in matters at all regardless of age. Now when everything is involved in relationship tracking is not a good phenomenon.
- This also raises the anxiety level in the children as they get a feeling of constantly being watched. This is also something not good for a child’s health.
