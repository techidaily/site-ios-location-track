A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number?

This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 13 mini via a number that is no longer available. However, there's a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.

So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number.

Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 13 mini, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.
