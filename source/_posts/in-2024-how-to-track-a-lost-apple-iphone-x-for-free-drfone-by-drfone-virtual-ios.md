## How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone X for Free?

A cell phone is a rather small device when compared to other things you may haul around on a daily basis such as a purse or wallet and even a bunch of keys. Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely.

But you’ve already paid a premium price for your cell phone, so what you really should do is learn how to track a lost phone for free?

3\. Go to its Settings > Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.
