Anti-tracker software generally immobilizes suspicious websites or plugins on your browsing device and prevents them from stealing your data online.

Just choose the best anti-tracking software that matches your needs and works perfectly with your situation.

One way or another, anti-tracker software can be of great help to you. Check out the list of benefits below to understand it very well. For sure, the information provided below can guide you towards the best anti-tracking software options.

![sensitive information](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-2.JPG)

In today’s digital era, where identity theft is rampant everywhere, privacy matters the most. Keeping our personal data away from public access is the least we can do to protect ourselves. That’s why you should consider installing anti-tracker software on your devices. Somehow, it can give you an assurance that the sensitive information you share online is not out in the open. But, of course, choose the best anti-tracking software that is powerful enough to do that for you.

### It keeps your browsing history private

What happens if hackers get their hands on your browsing history? Well, there are lots of possibilities, and most of them can directly affect you. Information pertaining to the websites you visit on the internet is mostly used by third-party partners for research and advertising. Hackers sell it to them, along with other sensitive information embedded in your browser. Of course, nobody wants that. It’s clearly an invasion of privacy. Therefore, install anti-tracker software on your device to prevent this kind of situation from happening.

### It prevents advertisers from using your private information

It is nice if the ads that show up while we’re browsing include products we’re personally interested in. Hence, we cannot deny that giving legitimate advertisers access to our preferences is somehow beneficial to a certain degree. However, there are some third-party affiliates that are quite aggressive in tracking our browsing data. We should get rid of that the moment we spot them red-handed. It’s best to use anti-tracker software just to be sure.

### It protects us from internet scams

That’s why you should do everything in your power to keep your data secure and private. Don’t let anyone get access to it as though your personal details are public materials. Start by being cautious when you share confidential information online. Before you give them out, make sure that the transaction and the website involved are legitimate. Another thing, install anti-tracker software on your device and activate it whenever you go online. Better be safe than sorry.

## How to Track Apple iPhone 11 by Phone Number

In most cases, tracking a lost iPhone has always been made possible thanks to the presence of tracking apps, and the use of the IMEI number. However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.

## Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?

A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 11, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 11 via a number that is no longer available. However, there's a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.

You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 11 in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 11, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.

## Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy

Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 11 from whoever has the phone. In this case, the application of [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) would be highly recommended. The mSpy program is a highly versatile program that can be used to perform various functions depending on the preferences of the user. In our case at hand, you can use this program to track your Apple iPhone 11 regardless of what part of the world the phone could have been taken to or located.

**TIP:** Please note that you can only track down your Apple iPhone 11 using mSpy by first installing the app on your phone. Without the installation process, tracking your phone using mSpy will be close to impossible.

The following is a detailed process on how to track an iPhone by number using mSpy phone locating feature.

#### **Step 1:** Purchase the App

Your first step is to go to the [mSpy official website](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) to download this program and install it on your Apple iPhone 11. What you need to do is to visit the official mSpy website and purchase the services offered by the program. The price you choose will depend on your preferences.

![Purchase the App](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14827039596334.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Download and Install the App

As for the details, please refer to how to install mSpy on Android and iPhone.

#### **Step 3:** Start Monitoring

With each and every step followed as required, your next step will be to start monitoring the targeted phone.

From this area, you will be in a position tell the location of the iPhone and check the route used over the specific period of time that the phone has been missing. All of this is made possible by the presence of the detailed map displayed on the control panel. There you have it. You can now track iPhone by phone number using mSpy without the knowledge of the current holder.

![Start Monitoring](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14827039946916.jpg)

Tracking a lost phone can be fun and at the same time a daunting task. The outcome or the general experience of tracking a lost phone will solely depend on the methods applied in the overall process. As we have seen in this article, though many people may argue that it is possible to track an iPhone by the number it is evident that the overall process can be problematic and in most cases, impossible. The only way out of tracking and finding your phone is by using the IMEI number. Any other number used for iPhone tracking purposes will only be for gathering information for investigative reasons.
