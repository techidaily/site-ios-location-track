Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.

![sign in to iCloud](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg)

![head to the Google Timeline to track your Apple iPhone 8 Plus](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png)
