A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number.

The moment you lose your Apple iPhone XR, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone XR via a number that is no longer available. However, there's a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.
