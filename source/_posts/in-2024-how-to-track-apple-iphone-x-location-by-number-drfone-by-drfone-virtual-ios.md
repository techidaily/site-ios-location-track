## Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)

Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.

The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.

Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.

**Features:**

GPS locator for car

Shows available parking.
