A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number?

This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone SE (2020) via a number that is no longer available. However, there's a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.

You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesnâ€™t change the SIM card.
