This app will help you locate a phone based on any number in your locality. Creepy neighbors- watch out!

This app allows you to track virtual phone numbers, lets you find your target phone's location, and also track the location of unknown mobile numbers. You can even conduct an email address search through this app and the whole service is entirely free!

## 4\. Caller ID & Number Locator

This app takes the cup for the day. With the phone number locator feature, it also comes with a call identifier.

With this, you can search and pinpoint the location of any mobile number or a fixed-line phone number in the world. This locator will run a database check to pull the exact location out for you, and moreover, it prints the same on the Google map to show you the target's phone's geographical location! Sounds cool, eh?

This is noted as the best leading app over the globe. There must be some better features compared to the previous ones if that's the case, yes?

It is cited to be the best caller ID app and it even blocks danger-rangers, their calls, and SMS. You can identify the person or the company that calls you before picking up. Be it landlines, mobile, or pre-paid even if you don't have the contact stored in your device!

You don't have to worry about telemarketers calling you or robocalls anymore. Spammers can't make an appearance ever again and consider yourself safe for life.

Where do you think these creators of number locators gather all this personal information from? It's absolutely frightening to think of how they would get hold of our information, isn't it? But, that's a topic for another day. It's certainly helpful if one doesn't misuse this information for their own personal gain now, right?
