## Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue

Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.

Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.

![sign in to iCloud](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg)

If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.

Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.

## Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue

Note that this solution will only work if you have Location Services enabled on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus.

It’s no surprise that both Apple and the search giant are fond of gathering information on all sorts of things, most notably your location. Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.

![head to the Google Timeline to track your Apple iPhone 7 Plus](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png)

Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.

Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.

Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.

## Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone 7 Plus

If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.

This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.

Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.

## Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing

This method requires that you have Find My Friend enabled on both your missing iPhone and the one you’re going to use to track it. Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device.

Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.

Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.

Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your Apple iPhone 7 Plus and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.

Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.

## Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?

Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.

**Odd Phone Behavior** – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.

**Battery Rundown** – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.

**Phone Shuts down** – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.

**Increased data usage** – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.

So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.

Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.

## Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones

**mSpy:**

[mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data.

So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.

**Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones**

To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:

**1\. Install mSpy and set it up**

To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.

**3\. Start monitoring**

You can now start intercepting the text messages remotely from other phones. Use your account through your login credentials and get reports from the target phone pertaining to text message history, chats, etc.

![intercept text messages-Start monitoring](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781244325874.jpg)

The above screen is the monitoring console through which we can see all the text messages on the target device. The control panel can be opened on any device i.e. phone or computer through the browser using the login credentials.

## Part 3: What you need to know when using mSpy

**Few things to know when using [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6):**

While the working, installation, and setting up of mSpy is very easy, there are a few things that need to be kept in mind while using mSpy.

1\. While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up. This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.

2\. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.

3\. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.

So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy. Hope this helps you in successfully and safely intercepting text messages.

## How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Apple iPhone 7 Plus

_“Is it possible to use Google Maps to calculate distance between multiple locations? I want to know the exact distance between different spots, but can’t seem to find any solution!”_

If you also wish to use the distance marker on Google Maps, then you might have a similar query like this. Apart from navigation, Google Maps can be used for different other applications as well. For instance, you can easily measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also use the Google Maps distance radius feature to focus on a certain area. In this guide, I will let you know how to use Google location distance and radius features in detail.

![google maps distance radius 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps

You might already know that Google Maps provides a map of the entire world for us to navigate. Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.

1. Firstly, just go to the official website of [Map Developers circle tool](https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php) on any supported browser like Google Chrome. You can see that the website is based on Google Maps with its added layers to draw a radius on the map.

![google maps distance radius 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-2.jpg)

1. Now, just use the native feature of the map to zoom in to any location of your choice. You can also enter the name of the location that you are looking for in the search bar.
2. Besides that, you can also enter details about the radius of the circle, its color, and so on. After entering all the needed details, click on the “New Circle” button and it will be reflected on Google Maps interface.

![google maps distance radius 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-3.jpg)

If you want, you can later delete this circle or draw multiple circles in different colors to mark them in any location of your choice.

## Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps

Apart from drawing a circle or radius on Google Maps, a lot of people would like to specify its distance as well. For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.

- _Map Developers Radius_

Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above. In this, you can just enter the name of a specific place on Google Maps. Now, you can specify the distance of radius in miles or kilometers. This will automatically draw the specific distance radius on Google Maps for the designated location.

## Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps

This is one of the most resourceful features of Google Maps that a lot of people are not aware of. Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:

1. At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.

1. Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu. From the available options on the context menu, click on “Measure Distance”.

1. Afterward, just click anywhere else on the map and it will automatically find a straight line distance in Google Maps between these two spots.
