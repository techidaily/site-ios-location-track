## 5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone XS without App

The Find My Apple iPhone XS app is a great addition to your Apple iPhone XS, and as the name suggests helps you to not only track your phone in the event it is stolen, but also lock it so that it cannot be misused. But what if you don’ have the app installed? Does that mean that you have to bid adieu to your Apple iPhone XS forever? Not really, because we are about to reveal to you 5 different ways to track your Apple iPhone XS without app, so you can hopefully find your phone in the condition it went astray.

## Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue

Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.

Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.

![sign in to iCloud](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg)

If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.

![skip the two factor authentication process](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg) ![head to the quick access link](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg)

Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.

![locate the Find iPhone icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181495657.jpg)

Step 3. Hover over to the All Devices dropdown menu and choose your Apple iPhone XS.

![choose your Apple iPhone XS](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181861335.jpg)

Step 4. The tracking process will now begin, and you should be able to see it displayed on an interactive map if successful.

![begin to track the phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075182429793.jpg)

Step 5. Once you know the exact location of your device, you can do one of three things—activate lost mode, trigger an acoustic signal or erase all data.

## Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue

Note that this solution will only work if you have Location Services enabled on your Apple iPhone XS.

It’s no surprise that both Apple and the search giant are fond of gathering information on all sorts of things, most notably your location. Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.

![head to the Google Timeline to track your Apple iPhone XS](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png)

Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.

Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.

Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.

## Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone XS

If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.

This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your Apple iPhone XS, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.

Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.

![Use Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone XS](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075191479909.jpg)

## Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing

This method requires that you have Find My Friend enabled on both your missing iPhone and the one you’re going to use to track it. Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Apple iPhone XS device.

Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.

Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.

Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your Apple iPhone XS and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.

Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.

![use another phone to track the missing one](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075192666907.jpg)

Step 4. When you’re ready to begin tracking, open up the Find My Friends app, click on their contact (your contact in this case) to see its exact location in real time.

## Part 1: How do people track your phone?

There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:

GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.

IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider's servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby

The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.

The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your Apple iPhone XS with ease.

## How to Track WhatsApp Messages on Apple iPhone XS Without Them Knowing?

Apps for messaging, such as WhatsApp, have transformed how people communicate. WhatsApp is the most popular and reliable messaging app worldwide, with over 2 billion active users. It is largely due to its extensive user base and advanced features. Moreover, it offers a convenient means to stay connected with friends and family. Nevertheless, concerns about privacy and security have also emerged among WhatsApp users.

WhatsApp promises that all messages are encrypted, giving users another great reason to use the service. But even a platform such as WhatsApp can be misused easily both by young and old and everyone in between. This is why it becomes important to install WhatsApp tracking software to know that it is used for good purposes. But the big question on your mind is **how to track WhatsApp chats on another phone**. We will discuss different techniques, including built-in features and WhatsApp trackers.

_**Pro Tip:** Are you being tracked by others? You can [fake your WhatsApp location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-whatsapp.html) to avoid this._

## Part 1: Can You Track Messages on WhatsApp?

Before going after **how to spy on someone's WhatsApp**, it is essential to find out if it is possible in the first place. WhatsApp is renowned for its end-to-end encryption. It is a security feature that ensures messages remain private. Moreover, these messages are accessible only to the intended recipients. This encryption makes it extremely challenging to intercept or track WhatsApp messages.

That means it is unlikely that tracking could be done directly through the app's servers. However, there are certain scenarios and methods through which WhatsApp messages can be tracked.
