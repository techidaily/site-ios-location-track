## How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max?

As scary as it sounds, it is actually quite possible that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. These hackers and sometimes amateurs make use of sophisticated spy software to infiltrate your device and have access to your information. If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and how to eliminate the threat. This article will help you with both.

## Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?

The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.

It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.

## Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?

The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.

#### **1\. Data Usage Spikes**

Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.

![Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg)

#### **2\. The Cydia App**

The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433\*29342” into the spotlight search.

![Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg)

#### **3\. A warm iPhone**

Do you notice that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.

![Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is warm](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg)

#### **4\. Background Noises**

When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.

## Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?

Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.

#### **1\. Install Anti-Spyware Program**

The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
#### **2\. Update your iOS**

Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.

To do it go to Settings > General > Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
#### **3\. Restore your Device**

Restoring your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.

![Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg)

Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.

Step 5. From here, you will need to click the dropdown labeled All Devices and select the target device. Once you select the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you wish to locate, you can either erase your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, send an audible alert or lock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.

#### **How to Track a Cell Location using Android Device Manager?**

If you’re an Android user, Google’s Android Device Manager presently known as Find My Device is activated by default on newer cell phones. Note that if you have an older Android phone, you can download ADM right from the Google Play Store.

![track a cell phone-use Android Device Manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082096225606.jpg)

Step 1. As long as you have your Google account connected with your Android device (again something you will have done when you first received the phone), you can now begin tracking by heading to Find My Device on the web.

Step 2. Sign in with your Google credentials, and you will be greeted with a dashboard that will show you where your cell phone is along with several other options.

Step 3. You can now do one of three things apart from viewing your cell location i.e. play sound, lock or erase device.

#### **Another Google Solution:**

Google recently has implemented some of the ADM features right into the web browser, meaning you can simply as the Search Giant to locate it for you from a simple web search. Of course, you will have to be logged into your Google account for this solution to work.

Step 1. Open the main Google search page and type in "find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max", and you should be presented with results showing your cell phone’s location.

## Part 3: How to Track a Cell Phone Location via mSpy?

We’ve just given you two solutions to how to track a cell phone location without installing software, but they are limited in the features they offer, meaning you can just check cell phone location. But there may be times when you may feel the need to get a comprehensive look or rather a mirror image of what your cell phone is being used for. And for that, there is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), an app that allows you to not only track Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max location but rings in with several other handy features.

Billed as the ultimate software for parental control, [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows PC and MAC OS and is easily accessible from any web browser. It is easy to install and if you experience any hiccups, you can always refer to the free online help. Further, it is available in several countries and backed by stellar multi-language customer support. mSpy offers three unique plans to choose from, each with its rich set of features that include the ability to manage calls, track text messages, read emails, track GPS location, monitor browsing history and internet use, control apps and programs and read instant messages from the app such as WhatsApp for a grand total of 24 features.

Step 1. After selecting the right plan for your needs, you will have to register the software.

![track a cell phone via mSpy-register the software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100202731.jpg)

Step 2. Next, you will have to set up the app with information on your target device and that’s it! You can now access the mSpy dashboard and begin tracking your cell phone location.

Step 3. You can select from several options in the left hand, two of the most noteworthy being geo-fencing and WhatsApp. Geo-fencing is a great feature to monitor both your kids and employees and basically, allows you to set up parameters and alert you when they are breached.

WhatsApp is a highly secure chat application, but mSpy backed by the latest technology also allows you to monitor its messages both incoming and outgoing. Simply click on the WhatsApp tab and you will be presented with a list of WhatsApp messages that you can further sort through by date.

There are several instances such as in the excitement of getting a new phone that we may overlook the need to install software to track a cell phone. But both Google and Apple are generous enough to offer a solution to track your cell phone location without having to install any third-party software. But if you’re like to do a lot more than just track your cell phone’s location, mSpy with its expensive list of features sets the gold standard in this space.
