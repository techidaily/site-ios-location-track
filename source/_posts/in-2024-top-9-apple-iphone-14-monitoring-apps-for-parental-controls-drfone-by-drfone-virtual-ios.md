### It keeps your browsing history private

What happens if hackers get their hands on your browsing history? Well, there are lots of possibilities, and most of them can directly affect you. Information pertaining to the websites you visit on the internet is mostly used by third-party partners for research and advertising. Hackers sell it to them, along with other sensitive information embedded in your browser. Of course, nobody wants that. Itâ€™s clearly an invasion of privacy. Therefore, install anti-tracker software on your device to prevent this kind of situation from happening.

### It prevents advertisers from using your private information

It is nice if the ads that show up while weâ€™re browsing include products weâ€™re personally interested in. Hence, we cannot deny that giving legitimate advertisers access to our preferences is somehow beneficial to a certain degree. However, there are some third-party affiliates that are quite aggressive in tracking our browsing data. We should get rid of that the moment we spot them red-handed. Itâ€™s best to use anti-tracker software just to be sure.

### It protects us from internet scams
