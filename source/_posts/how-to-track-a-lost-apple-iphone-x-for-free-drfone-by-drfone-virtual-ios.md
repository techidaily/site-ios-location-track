1. **How do I export WhatsApp chats to legal documents?**

To export WhatsApp chats to legal documents, you need to open WhatsApp on your device. Now locate the conversation you want to export and tap the three-dots option from the top right corner. From the ensuing menu options, select "More" and press “Export Chat.” You will be presented with options to include or exclude media in the export. Select the desired option to export the chat.

2. **Can I track WhatsApp messages on someone else's device without physical access?**

No, tracking WhatsApp messages on someone else's device requires physical access to that device. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted for all users. This means that they are only accessible on the Apple iPhone X device where the account was registered. To track someone's WhatsApp messages, you would generally need to install monitoring software. Along with that, you should gain physical access to their device to set up monitoring tools.

3. **Can I track WhatsApp messages if they are backed up on iCloud?**

WhatsApp provides users with the option to back up their chat history to iCloud. While these backups can help restore chats, they are not designed for real-time tracking purposes. To access the conversations in the backup files, you will need to use a tool or service with decryption capabilities. It is due to the fact that WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, tracking WhatsApp messages can be helpful in various scenarios. These scenarios range from monitoring your conversations to ensuring the safety of loved ones. Throughout this article, we have explored different methods on **how to track WhatsApp messages**. Each one had its advantages and limitations.

When it comes to spoofing your WhatsApp location to avoid being tracked by others, one recommended solution is Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. It offers a reliable and effective way to change your GPS location. By using this tool, you can easily set a different location on your device. Moreover, It will add an added layer of privacy and security.
