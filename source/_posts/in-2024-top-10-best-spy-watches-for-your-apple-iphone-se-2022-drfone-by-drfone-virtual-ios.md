## How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone SE (2022)?

As scary as it sounds, it is actually quite possible that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone SE (2022). These hackers and sometimes amateurs make use of sophisticated spy software to infiltrate your device and have access to your information. If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your Apple iPhone SE (2022), it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device and how to eliminate the threat. This article will help you with both.

## Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?

The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.

It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.

## Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?

The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.

#### **1\. Data Usage Spikes**

Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.

![Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg)

#### **2\. The Cydia App**

The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433\*29342” into the spotlight search.

![Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg)

#### **3\. A warm iPhone**

Do you notice that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.

![Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is warm](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg)

#### **4\. Background Noises**

When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.

## Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?

Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.

#### **1\. Install Anti-Spyware Program**

The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.

![Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg)

#### **2\. Update your iOS**

Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.

To do it go to Settings > General > Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”

![Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg)

#### **3\. Restore your Device**

Restoring your Apple iPhone SE (2022) in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.
