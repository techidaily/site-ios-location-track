## How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone XR for Free?

A cell phone is a rather small device when compared to other things you may haul around on a daily basis such as a purse or wallet and even a bunch of keys. Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely.

Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.

Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.

Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your Apple iPhone XR, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.
