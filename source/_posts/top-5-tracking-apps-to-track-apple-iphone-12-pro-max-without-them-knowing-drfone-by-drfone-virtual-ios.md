## 5\. Truecaller

This is noted as the best leading app over the globe. There must be some better features compared to the previous ones if that's the case, yes?

It is cited to be the best caller ID app and it even blocks danger-rangers, their calls, and SMS. You can identify the person or the company that calls you before picking up. Be it landlines, mobile, or pre-paid even if you don't have the contact stored in your device!

You don't have to worry about telemarketers calling you or robocalls anymore. Spammers can't make an appearance ever again and consider yourself safe for life.

**Features**

- This renowned app has got a block feature.
- This is the best- you can view the caller's profile that includes their name and photo!
- There is also a contact directory that will help you find an unknown number.
- You need not worry if your phonebook contacts get uploaded- this is an impossibility where Truecaller is concerned.
- If you end up calling the wrong number, they might search you up (!) and you would definitely know it too. Another perk!
- This app undoubtedly offers the best tracking services.

**Pros**

- Your phonebook contacts won't be uploaded online.
- It's easy to know if you were searched online (or, your number for that matter).
- It's possible to make calls directly from the app.
- This app has got over 200 million users as it offers the most trusted and efficient services to make their customers happy.

**Cons**

- It requests an Internet connection.
- You must supply your phone number to the makers for this app to work.

Where do you think these creators of number locators gather all this personal information from? It's absolutely frightening to think of how they would get hold of our information, isn't it? But, that's a topic for another day. It's certainly helpful if one doesn't misuse this information for their own personal gain now, right?
