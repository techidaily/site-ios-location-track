Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely. However, with the increase in modern mobile technology, there are several apps that can help you track your lost cell phone’s whereabouts. But you’ve already paid a premium price for your cell phone, so what you really should do is learn how to track a lost phone for free?

Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.

Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.
