## Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?

If you’ve misplaced your Android cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device), and locations services on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with. Here’s how to track your lost phone with Google’s ADM.

Step 1. Most latest Android phones are already equipped with the Find My Service, but if you’re missing it, you can download it from the Google Play Store. Click start, tap security, and then device administration.

Step 2. Next, tap Find My Device, and check the box besides it. Tap the back button once and then again to return to the main settings menu.

Step 3. To turn location services on, tap locations in the settings menu, tap mode so its turns green and then select high accuracy.

Step 4. When you need to locate your device, type find my device in a web browser and select what usually is the first link. Enter your email and password associated with your device account, and you will be presented with a dashboard, from where you can send an audible tone to your device even if it were on silent, lock your phone or erase it.
