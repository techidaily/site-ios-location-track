South Korea to regulate and safeguard teenage activities online have come up with an innovative law. It has made control of teenagers' phones a law and has determined that children, under the age of 19 who purchases a mobile phone are required to install an app that monitors their Internet activity. A failure or "forgetfulness" in the installation of such a surveillance system means that the newly purchased device would not work. In case you do not live in this country but still, you need to track your kid's device, do not doubt, use one of our iPhone monitoring apps for any emergency case and protect your kids from unwarranted exposure.
