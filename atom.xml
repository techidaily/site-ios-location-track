    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Solutions-to-Spy-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-with-and-without-jailbreak"><a href="#Solutions-to-Spy-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-with-and-without-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Solutions to Spy on Apple iPhone 15 Plus with and without jailbreak"></a>Solutions to Spy on Apple iPhone 15 Plus with and without jailbreak</h2><p>It is no secret that you can easily spy on any iPhone. Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup"                ></p><p>Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.</p><p>Step 4: You can then log in to your <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079748088200.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-log in to your mSpy control panel"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak"></a>Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak</h2><p>Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.</p><p>Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy"                ></p><p>Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the</p><p>device will however make it easier for the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.</p><h2 id="How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-by-Phone-Number"><a href="#How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-by-Phone-Number" class="headerlink" title="How to Track Apple iPhone 15 Plus by Phone Number"></a>How to Track Apple iPhone 15 Plus by Phone Number</h2><p>In most cases, tracking a lost iPhone has always been made possible thanks to the presence of tracking apps, and the use of the IMEI number. However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location - change your mobile device GPS to any place in the world with just 1 click <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number"><a href="#Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?"></a>Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?</h2><p>A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 15 Plus via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 15 Plus in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 15 Plus from whoever has the phone. In this case, the application of <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be highly recommended. The mSpy program is a highly versatile program that can be used to perform various functions depending on the preferences of the user. In our case at hand, you can use this program to track your Apple iPhone 15 Plus regardless of what part of the world the phone could have been taken to or located.</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Please note that you can only track down your Apple iPhone 15 Plus using mSpy by first installing the app on your phone. Without the installation process, tracking your phone using mSpy will be close to impossible.</p><p>The following is a detailed process on how to track an iPhone by number using mSpy phone locating feature.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Purchase-the-App"><a href="#Step-1-Purchase-the-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Purchase the App"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase the App</h4><p>Your first step is to go to the <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download this program and install it on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. What you need to do is to visit the official mSpy website and purchase the services offered by the program. The price you choose will depend on your preferences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14827039596334.jpg"                      alt="Purchase the App"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Download-and-Install-the-App"><a href="#Step-2-Download-and-Install-the-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Download and Install the App"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Download and Install the App</h4><p>Once you have made the purchase, a download link will be sent to your designated email address provided in the first step.

As for the details, please refer to how to install mSpy on Android and iPhone.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Start-Monitoring"><a href="#Step-3-Start-Monitoring" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Start Monitoring"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Start Monitoring</h4><p>With each and every step followed as required, your next step will be to start monitoring the targeted phone. For you to start tracking the phone, just login into your mSpy account and access the control panel. From this area, you will be in a position tell the location of the iPhone and check the route used over the specific period of time that the phone has been missing. All of this is made possible by the presence of the detailed map displayed on the control panel. There you have it. You can now track iPhone by phone number using mSpy without the knowledge of the current holder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14827039946916.jpg"                      alt="Start Monitoring"                ></p><p>Tracking a lost phone can be fun and at the same time a daunting task. The outcome or the general experience of tracking a lost phone will solely depend on the methods applied in the overall process. As we have seen in this article, though many people may argue that it is possible to track an iPhone by the number it is evident that the overall process can be problematic and in most cases, impossible. The only way out of tracking and finding your phone is by using the IMEI number. Any other number used for iPhone tracking purposes will only be for gathering information for investigative reasons.</p><h2 id="How-Do-I-Stop-Someone-From-Tracking-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus"><a href="#How-Do-I-Stop-Someone-From-Tracking-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Apple iPhone 15 Plus?"></a>How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Apple iPhone 15 Plus?</h2><p>It has now become very easy to track a Smartphone using the GPS features of the phone. This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.</p><p>You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do people track your phone?"></a>Part 1: How do people track your phone?</h2><p>There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.</p><p>The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your Apple iPhone 15 Plus with ease.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?"></a>Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, the following methods can be used to stop someone from tracking your device</p><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)"></a>1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)</h3><p>This is a tool that you can use to change the virtual location of your device(iOS or Android).

However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application.

Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max from whoever has the phone.

In most cases, you will have activated this feature already as soon as you unboxed the Apple iPhone 11 device, but if you haven’t, here are a few steps to complete the process.</p><p>Step 1. From your Apple iPhone 11, head to Settings, then tap your Apple ID, then iCloud, and lastly tap Find My iPhone to activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095192265.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-activate Find My iPhone"                ></p><p>Step 2. Once successfully activated, you can now track your Apple iPhone 11’s whereabouts in Apple’s iCloud from any web browser.</p><p>Step 3. Go to iCloud.com, and then log in using your credentials.</p><p>Step 4. Click on the Find iPhone button located in the second row.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095511390.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-use Apple’s iCloud"                ></p><p>Step 5. From here, you will need to click the dropdown labeled All Devices and select the target device. Once you select the Apple iPhone 11 device you wish to locate, you can either erase your Apple iPhone 11, send an audible alert or lock the Apple iPhone 11 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095893194.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-select the Apple iPhone 11 device you wish to locate"                ></p><h4 id="How-to-Track-a-Cell-Location-using-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#How-to-Track-a-Cell-Location-using-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="How to Track a Cell Location using Android Device Manager?"></a><strong>How to Track a Cell Location using Android Device Manager?</strong></h4><p>If you’re an Android user, Google’s Android Device Manager presently known as Find My Device is activated by default on newer cell phones. Note that if you have an older Android phone, you can download ADM right from the Google Play Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082096225606.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone-use Android Device Manager"                ></p><p>Step 1. As long as you have your Google account connected with your Android device (again something you will have done when you first received the phone), you can now begin tracking by heading to Find My Device on the web.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in with your Google credentials, and you will be greeted with a dashboard that will show you where your cell phone is along with several other options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082099019590.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone-Sign in with your Google credentials"                ></p><p>Step 3. You can now do one of three things apart from viewing your cell location i.e. play sound, lock or erase device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082099518488.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-view your cell location"                ></p><h4 id="Another-Google-Solution"><a href="#Another-Google-Solution" class="headerlink" title="Another Google Solution:"></a><strong>Another Google Solution:</strong></h4><p>Google recently has implemented some of the ADM features right into the web browser, meaning you can simply as the Search Giant to locate it for you from a simple web search. Of course, you will have to be logged into your Google account for this solution to work.</p><p>Step 1. Open the main Google search page and type in “find My Apple iPhone 11”, and you should be presented with results showing your cell phone’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082098089360.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone-type in"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Track-a-Cell-Phone-Location-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Track-a-Cell-Phone-Location-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Track a Cell Phone Location via mSpy?"></a>Part 3: How to Track a Cell Phone Location via mSpy?</h2><p>We’ve just given you two solutions to how to track a cell phone location without installing software, but they are limited in the features they offer, meaning you can just check cell phone location. But there may be times when you may feel the need to get a comprehensive look or rather a mirror image of what your cell phone is being used for. And for that, there is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an app that allows you to not only track Your Apple iPhone 11 location but rings in with several other handy features.</p><p>Billed as the ultimate software for parental control, <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows PC and MAC OS and is easily accessible from any web browser. It is easy to install and if you experience any hiccups, you can always refer to the free online help. Further, it is available in several countries and backed by stellar multi-language customer support. mSpy offers three unique plans to choose from, each with its rich set of features that include the ability to manage calls, track text messages, read emails, track GPS location, monitor browsing history and internet use, control apps and programs and read instant messages from the app such as WhatsApp for a grand total of 24 features.</p><p>Step 1. After selecting the right plan for your needs, you will have to register the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100202731.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-register the software"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, you will have to set up the app with information on your target device and that’s it! You can now access the mSpy dashboard and begin tracking your cell phone location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100515661.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-setup the app"                ></p><p>Step 3. You can select from several options in the left hand, two of the most noteworthy being geo-fencing and WhatsApp. Geo-fencing is a great feature to monitor both your kids and employees and basically, allows you to set up parameters and alert you when they are breached.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100786594.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-select from several options"                ></p><p>WhatsApp is a highly secure chat application, but mSpy backed by the latest technology also allows you to monitor its messages both incoming and outgoing. Simply click on the WhatsApp tab and you will be presented with a list of WhatsApp messages that you can further sort through by date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082101238393.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-sort through WhatsApp messages by date"                ></p><p>There are several instances such as in the excitement of getting a new phone that we may overlook the need to install software to track a cell phone. But both Google and Apple are generous enough to offer a solution to track your cell phone location without having to install any third-party software. But if you’re like to do a lot more than just track your cell phone’s location, mSpy with its expensive list of features sets the gold standard in this space.</p><h2 id="How-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-to-Stop-Tracking-You-on-Apple-iPhone-11"><a href="#How-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-to-Stop-Tracking-You-on-Apple-iPhone-11" class="headerlink" title="How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Apple iPhone 11"></a>How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Apple iPhone 11</h2><p>The location services that Google provides to Android smartphones are indeed useful in many ways. For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services. That’s indeed beneficial to all of us, especially in today’s ever-changing world. But definitely, it’s not possible if Google doesn’t have adequate location information from the pool of its users. Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments.

Either because you are in an unfamiliar city and you did not know how to return, or because you are thinking of something else while parking, you did not pay attention surely more than one occasion. To solve this type of problem, we propose a series of apps to find your car that will surely be useful when you park and make you remember that particular place thanks to the GPS locator for the car so check the following options and choose the best one for you and your car.</p><h2 id="Option-1-Find-My-Car"><a href="#Option-1-Find-My-Car" class="headerlink" title="Option 1: Find My Car"></a>Option 1: Find My Car</h2><p>Introduction: For many, this is one of the most popular apps, perhaps because it is free and is a car locator device available for iOS and Android. When we finish parking, through GPS the app sets your exact position so that to return to the car you just have to consult the map using Google Navigation, which will give us directions to get to the place where we left. In addition, this app permits to you to take photos of the place, add notes and even set a stopwatch in case you have parked in the wrong zone.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Use Google navigation to rich to your car faster.</p><p>Can store all the positions that you want.</p><p>Take photos from the parking location.</p><p>It is a free application</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082184344228.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-find my car"                ></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-my-car/id349510601?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-my-car/id349510601?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elibera.android.findmycar&amp;hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elibera.android.findmycar&amp;hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-2-Parkme"><a href="#Option-2-Parkme" class="headerlink" title="Option 2: Parkme"></a>Option 2: Parkme</h2><p>Introduction: This is another app to find your car with GPS locator for car dedicated to knowing where your car is. It is available for iPhone and Android, it’s free and allows you to help locate a car parking and later find the car. This app has three buttons on the main screen: find parking, save (to know where you parked) and look for the car. Thanks to this option, you have a map and a compass that will help guide you to get to the car. In addition, you can share the location of our car via Facebook, Twitter or SMS.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Vehicle locator connected to your iOS or Android device.</p><p>Can check available parking in your area.</p><p>It is free.</p><p>Can check the parking prices also in real time.</p><p>Has database for more than 500 cities in America, Europe, and more countries.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081722994485.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Parkme"                ></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/parkme-parking/id417605484?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/parkme-parking/id417605484?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parkme.consumer&amp;hl=es" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parkme.consumer&amp;hl=es <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-3-Automatic"><a href="#Option-3-Automatic" class="headerlink" title="Option 3: Automatic"></a>Option 3: Automatic</h2><p>Introduction: This is a car locator device system that helps us find where we parked our car. It works by connecting our car with the mobile phone and allowing us to know at all times the location of our car, something very useful in case of missing or even theft. In addition, in case of an accident, we can notify the emergency services through the same application.</p><p>This app to find your car consists of a sensor connected to the mobile application and all we have to do is install it in the OBD (On Board Diagnostics) port of our vehicle, usually located next to the instrument control or around of the center console. It is available for iOS. Apart from looking for the car, this app allows us to control through Bluetooth also the consumption of gasoline, the effort that has made the engine, if you suffer and how to avoid it while advising us on how to achieve and maintain optimal driving.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Can receive free emergency help in case of a crash.</p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Available in English.</p><p>Compatible with iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch</p><p>Control if you need gasoline through Bluetooth</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723208344.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Automatic"                ></p><p>URL:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version"><a href="#Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)"></a>Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)</h2><p>Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.</p><p>Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Shows available parking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723711372.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Google Maps"                ></p><p>URL is not available yet.</p><h2 id="Option-5-Waze"><a href="#Option-5-Waze" class="headerlink" title="Option 5: Waze"></a>Option 5: Waze</h2><p>Introduction: This app, compatible with Android and iOS is intended for users who go by car.</p><p>It allows to obtain routes and check movements in real time, besides visualizing possible obstacles in your way.</p><p>The application goes beyond navigation because it permits drivers to share road reports on accidents, police checks or any other danger along their way and get information about what is coming also. It uses satellite technology, so it does not require internet. This application helps you to find parking areas when you need one and can be activated as a GPS locator for the car.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>It is a car locator</p><p>Thanks to GPS you can find available parking</p><p>Get information in real-time if there is any problem in the way.</p><p>It is free and very easy to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081724223630.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Waze"                ></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>So, now onwards, you do not need to pay to get a GPS locator for the car, as you can see, there are many available options that you can use and choose to locate your car for free for both iOS and Android devices. You can take our recommendations from these different options. Just connect your car with your device, does not matter it’s operative system and start receiving information on where your car is and about the feasibility of parking area as well.</p><h2 id="How-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-to-Stop-Tracking-You-on-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus"><a href="#How-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-to-Stop-Tracking-You-on-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Apple iPhone 6 Plus"></a>How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Apple iPhone 6 Plus</h2><p>The location services that Google provides to Android smartphones are indeed useful in many ways. For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services. That’s indeed beneficial to all of us, especially in today’s ever-changing world. But definitely, it’s not possible if Google doesn’t have adequate location information from the pool of its users. Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products?

This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features.

This is a service that tells emergency services where you are located when you dial the emergency service number.</p><p>Google Location Accuracy. This is a GPS feature that uses the Wi-Fi address and other services to show your location.</p><p>Google Location History. With this, you can switch off the collection of your location history.</p><p>Google Location Sharing.

It works by masking your true IP address and then using servers in another location to fake your position. This tool is great for stopping people from tracking you using browser-based apps. It also does affect the GPS chip and stop it from transmitting your true location. Nord VPN has servers in countries all over the world, which means you can move your location to another continent to fool those who may be tracking you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokemon-go-spoofers-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go spoofers iphone 8"                ></p><h3 id="4-Fake-GPS-Go"><a href="#4-Fake-GPS-Go" class="headerlink" title="4) Fake GPS Go"></a>4) Fake GPS Go</h3><p>This is an app that you can download to your android device from Google Play Store. It is safe and will not affect the normal functioning of your device. Simply get it from Google Play Store, install it, and launch it. When it is up and running, you have to use the map interface to pin the new location that you want to teleport to. Anyone who may be tracking you will instantly be fooled that you are in the new location. You may also move around using the Joystick feature just as if you are on the ground in the teleport location.</p><p><strong>How to use Fake GPS Go</strong></p><ul><li>From the “Settings” app, navigate down to “About Phone” and then tap on “Build Number” seven times in order to enable the “Developer Options”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg"                      alt="android pokemon go spoofing 4"                ></p><ul><li>Launch Fake GPS go and the grant it the required access.

Choose a location far from your actual location and then pin it as your “real” location. This will instantly show that you have moved to this new location and throw off people who are tracking your Android device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-6.jpg"                      alt="android pokemon go spoofing 6"                ></p><h3 id="5-Fake-GPS-Free"><a href="#5-Fake-GPS-Free" class="headerlink" title="5) Fake GPS Free"></a>5) Fake GPS Free</h3><p>This is yet another tool that you can use to fake your GPS location and fool people who may be trying to track your Android device. The tool is quite light and does not use up system resources making it safe and easy to use.</p><ul><li>Begin by unlocking the developer options just like you did in the step above. Then proceed to Google Play Store and download and install Fake GPs free.</li><li>Go to “Settings &gt; Developer options &gt; Mock Location App”. Here you will select Fake GPS Free and then grant it the necessary permissions on your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-7.jpg"                      alt="android pokemon go spoofing 7"                ></p><ul><li>Return to your Home screen and the Launch Fake GPS free. Access the map interface and then check for a location far from your actual position.

You need to know that you are safe all the time and this is a step that you should take when you feel like you are being tracked for nefarious reasons. However, you should do this with caution as the information can also be used in a beneficial manner. The best option is to turn on the GPS when you need it and then turn it off when you do not, or use an iOS spoofing tool.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"

Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup"                ></p><p>Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.</p><p>Step 4: You can then log in to your <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079748088200.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-log in to your mSpy control panel"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak"></a>Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak</h2><p>Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.</p><p>Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy"                ></p><p>Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the</p><p>device will however make it easier for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Best-Spy-Watches-For-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#Top-10-Best-Spy-Watches-For-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max"></a>Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</h2><p>If you’re looking for some hidden and discreet spy gear to take video and audio recordings without anyone knowing, or to take snapshots discreetly, then your best bet is to get a nice spy watch.

But real spy work actually happens behind a computer screen. In the age of information technology, people keep all their most valuable information stored on phones. As such, if you have access to someone’s phone, you have access to all their secrets. However, breaking into someone’s phone doesn’t require years of hacking and coding practice as most people believe.

If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?"></a>Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?</h2><p>When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy"                ></p><p>1. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.</p><p>2. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.</p><p>3. Go to its Settings &gt; Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600151360.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-download from Unknown Sources"                ></p><p>4. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.</p><p>5. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.</p><p>6. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600392625.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-access its web-based dashboard"                ></p><p>Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?"></a>Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?</h2><p>As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – <a class="link"   href="https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/" >KidsGuard Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It provided a highly reliable and secure way to track a device’s location, its vital content, and so much more. Easy to download and use, KidsGuard Pro doesn’t require you to root your Android device. After installing it on the target device, you can track it from the web dashboard control panel remotely.</p><p>Since it runs in stealth mode, it allowed me to track my boyfriend’s phone without getting detected. Besides his real-time location, I was able to know his call logs, contacts, photos, social media activity, and so much more in one place. It allowed me to track my boyfriend in a trouble-free manner. You can also do the same by following these steps:</p><p>1. Firstly, visit KidsGuard Pro’s official website right <a class="link"   href="https://panel.clevguard.com/sign-up?dev_tp=android" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your new account. You need to sign-up with your email id and set up a strong password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/create-an-account-for-clevguard.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-sign up KidsGuard Pro"                ></p><p>2. Secondly, after buying the product, you need to download the KidsGuard Pro app on your target device. Please go to the My Products and Orders Management page and click “Setup Guide” to follow the instructions carefully and complete all settings on the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/click-android-setup-guide.jpg"                      alt="complete the settings"                ></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXtNaHFBoXo" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>3. Great! Now all you need to do is log in to your KidsGuard Pro account on their website using your account credentials. On the home page, you can access all the major information related to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device like its location, frequent callers, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/android-control-panel.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-log-in to KidsGuard Pro’s dashboard"                ></p><p>4. Furthermore, you can simply visit the desired section from the left panel to get in-depth access. For instance, by visiting the “Locations” section, you can view the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, the previously visited places, and more.</p><p>After following these instructions, I was also able to track my boyfriend without much trouble. KidsGuard Pro also provides a seamless way to track the social media activity on the target device, record calls, listen to its surroundings, etc. Furthermore, you can enable its Keylogging feature as well to get a comprehensive record of everything typed on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. By using these amazing features, I was able to track my boyfriend’s phone without getting detected.</p><p>Since KidsGuard Pro is compatible with all the leading Android and iOS devices, you can take its assistance without facing any setbacks. I used it to track my boyfriend’s phone and so can you. Nevertheless, before you proceed, make sure that you are not doing anything illegal. You should either own the phone you are tracking or inform the other person beforehand. This will prevent you from any unforeseen situation. Now when you know better, you can easily use KidsGuard Pro to track any Android or iOS device.

You can look through several different spy watches online, but the vast number of models can get disconcerting.

It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps.

While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up. This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.</p><p>2. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.</p><p>So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy. Hope this helps you in successfully and safely intercepting text messages.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-a-lost-apple-iphone-15-plus-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 15 Plus for Free?

Apart from navigation, Google Maps can be used for different other applications as well. For instance, you can easily measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also use the Google Maps distance radius feature to focus on a certain area. In this guide, I will let you know how to use Google location distance and radius features in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-1.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps"></a>Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps</h2><p>You might already know that Google Maps provides a map of the entire world for us to navigate. Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.</p><ol><li>Firstly, just go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php" >Map Developers circle tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any supported browser like Google Chrome.

You can also enter the name of the location that you are looking for in the search bar.</li><li>Besides that, you can also enter details about the radius of the circle, its color, and so on. After entering all the needed details, click on the “New Circle” button and it will be reflected on Google Maps interface.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-3.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 3"                ></p><p>If you want, you can later delete this circle or draw multiple circles in different colors to mark them in any location of your choice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps"></a>Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps</h2><p>Apart from drawing a circle or radius on Google Maps, a lot of people would like to specify its distance as well. For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.</p><ul><li><em>Map Developers Radius</em></li></ul><p>Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above. In this, you can just enter the name of a specific place on Google Maps. Now, you can specify the distance of radius in miles or kilometers. This will automatically draw the specific distance radius on Google Maps for the designated location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-4.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 4"                ></p><ul><li><em>KML Circle Generator</em></li></ul><p>If you know the exact longitude and latitude of the place, then you can also take the assistance of KML Circle Generator. In this, you would have to specify the exact coordinates of the place and the Google Maps distance radius value. After entering the relevant details, you can proceed and draw the radius distance on Google Maps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-5.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 5"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Determine-the-Distance-between-two-Addresses-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-3-Determine-the-Distance-between-two-Addresses-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps"></a>Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps</h2><p>This is one of the most resourceful features of Google Maps that a lot of people are not aware of. Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-6.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 6"                ></p><ol><li>Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu.

It doesn’t matter if it is your present location or not. If you want to measure distance in some other location, then just enter its name in the search bar to load it. In this way, you can measure distance anywhere in the world by sitting in your home.</p><p>This brings us to the end of this extensive guide on using Google Maps distance and radius features. As you can see, I have provided a smart and user-friendly solution to draw radius distance on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also follow the above guide to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps.

You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device.

Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services.

Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products? If so, you can start by giving Google access to the location data on your Android smartphone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location - change your mobile device GPS to any place in the world with just 1 click <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number"><a href="#Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?"></a>Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?</h2><p>A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 15 Plus via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 15 Plus in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 15 Plus from whoever has the phone. In this case, the application of <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be highly recommended. The mSpy program is a highly versatile program that can be used to perform various functions depending on the preferences of the user. In our case at hand, you can use this program to track your Apple iPhone 15 Plus regardless of what part of the world the phone could have been taken to or located.</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Please note that you can only track down your Apple iPhone 15 Plus using mSpy by first installing the app on your phone. Without the installation process, tracking your phone using mSpy will be close to impossible.</p><p>The following is a detailed process on how to track an iPhone by number using mSpy phone locating feature.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Purchase-the-App"><a href="#Step-1-Purchase-the-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Purchase the App"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase the App</h4><p>Your first step is to go to the <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download this program and install it on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.

All of this is made possible by the presence of the detailed map displayed on the control panel. There you have it.

The outcome or the general experience of tracking a lost phone will solely depend on the methods applied in the overall process. As we have seen in this article, though many people may argue that it is possible to track an iPhone by the number it is evident that the overall process can be problematic and in most cases, impossible. The only way out of tracking and finding your phone is by using the IMEI number. Any other number used for iPhone tracking purposes will only be for gathering information for investigative reasons.</p><h2 id="How-to-Intercept-Text-Messages-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus"><a href="#How-to-Intercept-Text-Messages-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone 15 Plus"></a>How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone 15 Plus</h2><p>With the increase in the use of smartphones nowadays, the applications for smartphones have gone on to become equally smarter. For instance, text messages which are one of the most important components of every phone, can now be easily intercepted or spied on, courtesy some smart applications. Yes, it is a matter of minutes now to be able to spy on or intercept text messages even when not having the target device in your possession. Moreover, there are applications that work on all platforms whether it is android or iOS. But how do you intercept text messages? Well, if this is what’s playing in your mind; you are absolutely at the right place. In this article, we are going to discuss ways to intercept text messages from both iOS and Android Phones and how to know whether your text messages have been intercepted.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended android&#x2F;ios location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Virtual Location - the most trustworthy way to fake GPS on iPhone &#x2F;Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="fake GPS of mobile device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?"></a>Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?</h2><p>Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data. This feature helps when the phone is stolen. Installing mSpy on the target phone is extremely simple and involves very few steps. So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.</p><p><strong>Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones</strong></p><p>To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Intercept-Text-Messages-on-Apple-iPhone-X"><a href="#How-to-Intercept-Text-Messages-on-Apple-iPhone-X" class="headerlink" title="How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone X"></a>How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone X</h2><p>With the increase in the use of smartphones nowadays, the applications for smartphones have gone on to become equally smarter. For instance, text messages which are one of the most important components of every phone, can now be easily intercepted or spied on, courtesy some smart applications. Yes, it is a matter of minutes now to be able to spy on or intercept text messages even when not having the target device in your possession. Moreover, there are applications that work on all platforms whether it is android or iOS. But how do you intercept text messages? Well, if this is what’s playing in your mind; you are absolutely at the right place. In this article, we are going to discuss ways to intercept text messages from both iOS and Android Phones and how to know whether your text messages have been intercepted.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended android&#x2F;ios location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Virtual Location - the most trustworthy way to fake GPS on iPhone &#x2F;Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="fake GPS of mobile device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?"></a>Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?</h2><p>Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data. This feature helps when the phone is stolen. Installing mSpy on the target phone is extremely simple and involves very few steps. So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.</p><p><strong>Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones</strong></p><p>To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2.

While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up. This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.</p><p>2. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3.

If you don’t want it to happen, there’s an alternative solution you can try. Rather than denying Google access to your location, why not change it instead and register a fake one? Yes. That can absolutely help you conceal your whereabouts without compromising the quality of Google services. Don’t worry. It’s a piece of cake. Wondershare Dr.Fone can help you a lot in this regard.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Ways-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-without-App"><a href="#5-Ways-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-without-App" class="headerlink" title="5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 11 Pro without App"></a>5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 11 Pro without App</h2><p>The Find My Apple iPhone 11 Pro app is a great addition to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, and as the name suggests helps you to not only track your phone in the event it is stolen, but also lock it so that it cannot be misused. But what if you don’ have the app installed? Does that mean that you have to bid adieu to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro forever? Not really, because we are about to reveal to you 5 different ways to track your Apple iPhone 11 Pro without app, so you can hopefully find your phone in the condition it went astray.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue"><a href="#Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue"></a>Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue</h2><p>Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.</p><p>Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg"                      alt="sign in to iCloud"                ></p><p>If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg"                      alt="skip the two factor authentication process"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg"                      alt="head to the quick access link"                ></p><p>Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181495657.jpg"                      alt="locate the Find iPhone icon"                ></p><p>Step 3. Hover over to the All Devices dropdown menu and choose your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181861335.jpg"                      alt="choose your Apple iPhone 11 Pro"                ></p><p>Step 4. The tracking process will now begin, and you should be able to see it displayed on an interactive map if successful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075182429793.jpg"                      alt="begin to track the phone"                ></p><p>Step 5. Once you know the exact location of your device, you can do one of three things—activate lost mode, trigger an acoustic signal or erase all data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Solution-2-Google-to-the-Rescue"><a href="#Part-2-Solution-2-Google-to-the-Rescue" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue"></a>Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue</h2><p>Note that this solution will only work if you have Location Services enabled on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.</p><p>It’s no surprise that both Apple and the search giant are fond of gathering information on all sorts of things, most notably your location. Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png"                      alt="head to the Google Timeline to track your Apple iPhone 11 Pro"                ></p><p>Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.</p><p>Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.</p><p>Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone 11 Pro"></a>Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone 11 Pro</h2><p>If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.</p><p>This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.</p><p>Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar.

Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone 11 Pro is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4.

These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2.

This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3.

Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-for-Free"><a href="#How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 15 Plus for Free?"></a>How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 15 Plus for Free?</h2><p>A cell phone is a rather small device when compared to other things you may haul around on a daily basis such as a purse or wallet and even a bunch of keys. Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely. However, with the increase in modern mobile technology, there are several apps that can help you track your lost cell phone’s whereabouts. But you’ve already paid a premium price for your cell phone, so what you really should do is learn how to track a lost phone for free?</p><p>And if you haven’t done so already, you should also install apps whether paid or free that do more than GPS location tracking such as monitoring incoming and outgoing calls, text and multimedia messages. So if you’re wondering how to track your lost phone for free, we’ve got a few solutions that will help you do just that, and others that bring to the table a wide range of great features.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?"></a>Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?</h2><p>One of the noteworthy features of iPhones is that they tend to retain great value for many years to come hence they become a preferred choice for prying thieves. Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your Apple iPhone 15 Plus can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.</p><p>But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.</p><p>Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080421681564.jpeg"                      alt="track your lost phone for free with iCloud"                ></p><p>Step 2. Now it’s time to hit the cloud—iCloud we mean! First things first—head to &lt;<a href="http://www.iCloud.com>">www.iCloud.com&gt;</a> from any browser and login with your credentials. From the dashboard, click on Find iPhone in the second row and enter your Apple ID and password if prompted. Since you may have several Apple devices connected with the same iCloud account, click on All Devices at the top, and select the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you wish to track from the dropdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422049397.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for free-click on Find iPhone and All Devices"                ></p><p>Step 3. That’s really all there is to it! Once you select your device, you can do one of three things—play sound, activate lost mode or erase the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to prevent compromise of information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422409247.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for frees-start to track"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?</h2><p>If you’ve misplaced your Android cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device), and locations services on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with.

Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface.

Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-6.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 6"                ></p><ol><li>Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu. From the available options on the context menu, click on “Measure Distance”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-7.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 7"                ></p><ol><li>Afterward, just click anywhere else on the map and it will automatically find a straight line distance in Google Maps between these two spots.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-8.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 8"                ></p><ol><li>If you want to continue, then just click anywhere else on the map and that will be considered as the next spot. Therefore, you can just click as many times as you want to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-9.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 9"                ></p><p>This technique will let you measure distance between any addresses on Google Maps. It doesn’t matter if it is your present location or not. If you want to measure distance in some other location, then just enter its name in the search bar to load it. In this way, you can measure distance anywhere in the world by sitting in your home.</p><p>This brings us to the end of this extensive guide on using Google Maps distance and radius features. As you can see, I have provided a smart and user-friendly solution to draw radius distance on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also follow the above guide to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. In the same way, you can also let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. Go ahead and try these Google Maps distance and radius hacks and share your experience with us in the comments below.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="You-Might-Also-Like"><a href="#You-Might-Also-Like" class="headerlink" title="You Might Also Like"></a>You Might Also Like</h2><h2 id="Location-based-apps"><a href="#Location-based-apps" class="headerlink" title="Location-based apps"></a>Location-based apps</h2><p>GPS spoof for dating apps</p><p>GPS spoof for social apps</p><p>Pokemon Go on PC</p><p>AR game tricks</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/virtual-location-horizontal.png"                      alt="virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Change Phone GPS Location Easily</strong></p><ul><li>● Teleport GPS location to anywhere</li><li>● Play AR games without moving</li><li>● Spoof Location on the popular Apps</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Try Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/best-anti-tracker-software-for-apple-iphone-6s-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Best Anti Tracker Software For Apple iPhone 6s Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/top-5-car-locator-apps-for-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Top 5 Car Locator Apps for Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-best-spy-watches-for-your-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Apple iPhone 13 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-apple-iphone-13-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Apple iPhone 13 mini | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-find-your-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-current-location-of-a-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>3 Solutions to Find Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Current Location of a Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-detect-and-remove-spyware-on-apple-iphone-se-2022-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone SE (2022)?

Anyone who may be tracking you will instantly be fooled that you are in the new location. You may also move around using the Joystick feature just as if you are on the ground in the teleport location.</p><p><strong>How to use Fake GPS Go</strong></p><ul><li>From the “Settings” app, navigate down to “About Phone” and then tap on “Build Number” seven times in order to enable the “Developer Options”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg"                      alt="android pokemon go spoofing 4"                ></p><ul><li>Launch Fake GPS go and the grant it the required access.

You need to know that you are safe all the time and this is a step that you should take when you feel like you are being tracked for nefarious reasons. However, you should do this with caution as the information can also be used in a beneficial manner. The best option is to turn on the GPS when you need it and then turn it off when you do not, or use an iOS spoofing tool.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"

This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features.

Anyone who may be tracking you will instantly be fooled that you are in the new location.

Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup"                ></p><p>Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.</p><p>Step 4: You can then log in to your <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079748088200.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-log in to your mSpy control panel"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak"></a>Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak</h2><p>Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.</p><p>Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy"                ></p><p>Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device if TruthSpy will be able to access it.

Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 11 device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 11 is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2.

Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3.

If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Spy-on-Text-Messages-from-Computer-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Spy-on-Text-Messages-from-Computer-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Spy on Text Messages from Computer &amp; Apple iPhone 13 Pro"></a>How to Spy on Text Messages from Computer &amp; Apple iPhone 13 Pro</h2><p>Do you suspect that your child is communicating with the wrong individuals? While cellphones are meant to give everyone the ability to communicate, their secretive nature can also nurture society’s ills, and children, especially teenagers can fall prey to these. Yet, as a parent, it can be very hard to monitor what your child is doing on your device. That’s why we thought it wise to share with you a few ways you can spy on someone’s text messages from your device or computer.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-another-Android-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-another-Android-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on text messages from another Android phone"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on text messages from another Android phone</h2><p>To spy on another android device’s text messages, you will need to install spy software on that device. One of the best monitoring programs for the task is eyeZy. It is affordable, easy to install, and above all gives you access to the target device’s text messages remotely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.eyezy.com/" >EyeZy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can also provide you with a wealth of other information about the target device including call history, browsing history, and even GPS location.</p><p>Here’s how to spy on another Android device’s text messages using eyeZy.</p><p>Step 1: The first step is to register for an eyeZy account on the eyeZy website. You can choose to purchase a 1 monthly&#x2F;3 monthly&#x2F;12 monthly subscription.</p><p>Step 2: Once you’ve registered and paid for your account, you will receive an email with all the information to help you download and install the software. The set-up wizard is very detailed and easy to follow.</p><p>Step 3: Once set up is complete, you can go to your eyeZy dashboard on any other Android device to begin monitoring the text messages on the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/spy-on-text-messages-eyezy.jpg"                      alt="Spy on Text Messages from another Android phone using eyeZy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-another-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-another-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spy on text messages from another iPhone"></a>Part 2: How to Spy on text messages from another iPhone</h2><p>For iPhone users, one of the best spy apps to use is Auto Forward. This app allows users to spy on another iPhone without the target device’s owner knowing. It has a major advantage in that it allows the user to see all messages including those the owner of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device may have deleted. You can also see both sent and received messages.</p><p>Here’s how to use Auto Forward to spy on another iPhone’s text messages.</p><p>Step 1: To begin with, download and install Auto Forward onto your computer or another iOS device.</p><p>Step 2: Log in to your account (that you would have created before installing the app) and enter the Apple ID and password of the iPhone you want to spy on.</p><p>Step 3: The app will automatically access all messages on the target device. It will however only work if you have the target device’s Apple login details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074689453332.jpg"                      alt="Spy on text messages from another iPhone via Auto Forward"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-computer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Spy on text messages from computer"></a>Part 3: How to Spy on text messages from computer</h2><p>If you want to spy on someone else’s text messages on your computer, a monitoring program like <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be a good choice. As one of the best spy apps in the business, mSpy gives you the ability to monitor any device both Android and iOS remotely from any computer. It is easy to install and will provide you with additional information about the target device including call history, browsing history, and even email tracking.</p><p>Here’s how to <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >use mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to spy on another phone’s text messages.</p><p>Step 1: You will need to first purchase a mSpy subscription from the program’s website. There are a lot of plans to choose from so choose one that meets your needs.</p><p>Step 2: Once you’ve paid for your subscription, mSpy will send you an email with your login information as well as installation information. The steps are easy to follow.</p><p>Step 3: You should be able to log in to your web-based control panel and view the messages as soon as the installation is complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074696134452.jpg"                      alt="Spy on text messages from computer via mSpy"                ></p><p>The above three solutions enable users to monitor more than just text messages. They give parents the ability to keep track of what their children are saying to one another or who they are talking to. While there are many applications to spy monitoring software, perhaps the most important is in ensuring the safety of our young people.</p><h2 id="5-Ways-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-without-App"><a href="#5-Ways-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-without-App" class="headerlink" title="5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 13 Pro without App"></a>5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 13 Pro without App</h2><p>The Find My Apple iPhone 13 Pro app is a great addition to your Apple iPhone 13 Pro, and as the name suggests helps you to not only track your phone in the event it is stolen, but also lock it so that it cannot be misused.

For sure, the information provided below can guide you towards the best anti-tracking software options.</p><h3 id="It-restricts-anyone-from-accessing-and-stealing-your-personal-information"><a href="#It-restricts-anyone-from-accessing-and-stealing-your-personal-information" class="headerlink" title="It restricts anyone from accessing and stealing your personal information"></a>It restricts anyone from accessing and stealing your personal information</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-2.JPG"                      alt="sensitive information"                ></p><p>In today’s digital era, where identity theft is rampant everywhere, privacy matters the most. Keeping our personal data away from public access is the least we can do to protect ourselves. That’s why you should consider installing anti-tracker software on your devices. Somehow, it can give you an assurance that the sensitive information you share online is not out in the open. But, of course, choose the best anti-tracking software that is powerful enough to do that for you.</p><h3 id="It-keeps-your-browsing-history-private"><a href="#It-keeps-your-browsing-history-private" class="headerlink" title="It keeps your browsing history private"></a>It keeps your browsing history private</h3><p>What happens if hackers get their hands on your browsing history? Well, there are lots of possibilities, and most of them can directly affect you. Information pertaining to the websites you visit on the internet is mostly used by third-party partners for research and advertising. Hackers sell it to them, along with other sensitive information embedded in your browser. Of course, nobody wants that. It’s clearly an invasion of privacy. Therefore, install anti-tracker software on your device to prevent this kind of situation from happening.</p><h3 id="It-prevents-advertisers-from-using-your-private-information"><a href="#It-prevents-advertisers-from-using-your-private-information" class="headerlink" title="It prevents advertisers from using your private information"></a>It prevents advertisers from using your private information</h3><p>It is nice if the ads that show up while we’re browsing include products we’re personally interested in. Hence, we cannot deny that giving legitimate advertisers access to our preferences is somehow beneficial to a certain degree. However, there are some third-party affiliates that are quite aggressive in tracking our browsing data. We should get rid of that the moment we spot them red-handed. It’s best to use anti-tracker software just to be sure.</p><h3 id="It-protects-us-from-internet-scams"><a href="#It-protects-us-from-internet-scams" class="headerlink" title="It protects us from internet scams"></a>It protects us from internet scams</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-3.JPG"                      alt="internet scam frauds"                ></p><p>Identity theft is one. But to tell you, internet fraud scams come in a variety of forms. Although each of them differs at some point, most of the attacks start from stolen information. That’s why you should do everything in your power to keep your data secure and private. Don’t let anyone get access to it as though your personal details are public materials. Start by being cautious when you share confidential information online. Before you give them out, make sure that the transaction and the website involved are legitimate. Another thing, install anti-tracker software on your device and activate it whenever you go online.

Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup"                ></p><p>Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.</p><p>Step 4: You can then log in to your <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079748088200.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-log in to your mSpy control panel"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak"></a>Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak</h2><p>Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.</p><p>Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy"                ></p><p>Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the</p><p>device will however make it easier for the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.</p><h2 id="Top-4-Ways-to-Trace-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Location"><a href="#Top-4-Ways-to-Trace-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Location" class="headerlink" title="Top 4 Ways to Trace Apple iPhone 11 Pro Location"></a>Top 4 Ways to Trace Apple iPhone 11 Pro Location</h2><p>Have you ever wondered about keeping a track of where your children and family members are, where they are going, are they safe?
