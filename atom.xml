This addition addresses one of the RAX120’s most significant flaws—the absence of cyber security and anti-malware software.</p><p> <em>We purchased the Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-netgear-routers-4159862" >Netgear <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Nighthawk RAX120 is supposed to provide lightning-fast speeds while serving as one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >best long-range wireless routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> currently on the market.

I tested the Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 to see how well it performs in the real world.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Batman’s-router"><a href="#Design-Batman’s-router" class="headerlink" title="Design: Batman’s router"></a><strong>Design: Batman’s router</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 has a futuristic design—angular, with clean lines. It looks like a cross between a spaceship and the Batmobile. It’s matte black and rectangular, but instead of the multiple antennas you’d typically see protruding from the top of a Nighthawk router, it has two wing-like extensions that come from each side.</p><p> The eight antennas are housed inside of the two wings, so they’re not visible. The antennas are supposed to be ideally pre-positioned for you to get the best possible connection. However, because the eight individual antennas are housed within the wings, you can’t adjust them to your liking. The wings are on hinges though, so can fold down the wings to store the router, as the unit is somewhat large and bulky. It weighs three pounds, and it measures about a foot wide and almost eight inches in depth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fw0FJuD9bAOkQEHuAZ9OFq5toXk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetGear_LongRangeRouters_Nighthawk_RAX120_05-2a03227466354aad82fe55b884b76ac6-4d18f476974a44b081aafc943a8e56b1.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX12"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39694080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/nbr/fire/Screenshot_1red_gb.jpg"                      border="0"                >Nero Burning ROM:<br>The ultimate burning program for all your needs!</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup: Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk app walks you through the setup process. There’s a QR code sticker on the router, as well as a temporary network name and password on the label, which allow you to connect quickly and easily.</p><p> The app guides you through creating separate 2.4 and 5GHz networks, but you can also take advantage of a feature called smart connect, which combines your networks and designates your devices based on optimal performance. You can create a guest network, as well as manage and monitor your devices individually. The initial setup process took me about ten minutes in total.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Superfast-speeds"><a href="#Connectivity-Superfast-speeds" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Superfast speeds"></a><strong>Connectivity: Superfast speeds</strong></h2><p> The RAX120 is a workhorse. It’s classified as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but there’s also a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >tri-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> version available (the RAX200). The RAX120 supports 802.11ax, which is also known as Wi-Fi 6. Although Wi-Fi 6 is still relatively new, the addition of Wi-Fi 6 future-proofs the RAX120 to a certain degree. It allows for faster speeds, better battery life on your Wi-Fi 6 compatible and IoT devices, and less congestion on your network.</p><p> With the addition of 802.11ax, the RAX120 also supports 8-stream MU-MIMO, which means your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-routers-4038590" >wireless router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can communicate with several streaming devices at the same time without experiencing too much congestion. Support for beamforming and Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) also promotes better performance. The RAX120 is backwards compatible with 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac as well, so it’ll work with virtually all of your devices, Wi-Fi 6 or not.</p><p> The RAX120 has four Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back (two of which can be combined to support a larger file transfer rate of 2 GB) and a multigig Ethernet port that supports speeds up to 5 gigs. I was impressed overall with the location and specifications of the ports, but I would have liked to see more Ethernet ports on a router this expensive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/y2V4Ncx3Z1ul8B-4lsc_IeiyCRQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetGear_LongRangeRouters_Nighthawk_RAX120_04-9e452ddedd2b4a46893fddd147c06d4f.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX12"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Network-performance-Stellar"><a href="#Network-performance-Stellar" class="headerlink" title="Network performance: Stellar"></a><strong>Network performance: Stellar</strong></h2><p> The Nighthawk RAX120 indicates top speeds of 1,200 Mbps on the 2.4Ghz band and 4,800 Mbps on the 5Ghz band. My Internet speed maxes out at 500 Mbps. I have about 50 connected devices, more than half of which are smart home devices like smart light switches, smart appliances, security cameras, and smart speakers and displays. The RAX120 had no problem managing my numerous smart devices, nor did I experience any lag or connectivity issues on streaming and gaming devices. I simultaneously ran a gaming computer, two playstations, and two FireTVs without the connection missing a beat.</p><p> I used the smart connect feature when testing the router’s speeds, and it did a decent job of moving me to the appropriate band as I traveled throughout my home. On an 802.11ax compatible iPhone, the Nighthawk RAX120 clocked speeds of 469 Mbps while in the same room as the router. Proximity to the router had little impact in Wi-Fi speeds, as the speeds only dropped slightly (to 455 Mbps) when I traveled to the opposite end of my 1,600 square foot home. When I went out to the backyard, however, the speeds dropped more dramatically (to 385 Mbps).</p><p> On my laptop, which is not Wi-Fi 6 compatible, the speed maxed out at 410 Mbps, and I saw a substantial drop in the backyard (to 280 Mbps), just as I saw with the phone. The router has an impressive range overall, and I didn’t experience any dead zones, which has been a problem with other routers in the past. The speeds on the RAX120 did slow down when faced with obstructions though, especially outdoor walls and appliances.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> The RAX120 is backward compatible with 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac as well, so it’ll work with virtually all of your devices, Wi-Fi 6 or not.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-Quality-hardware-lacks-antivirus"><a href="#Key-Features-Quality-hardware-lacks-antivirus" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: Quality hardware, lacks antivirus"></a><strong>Key Features: Quality hardware, lacks antivirus</strong></h2><p> Under the hood, the Nighthawk RAX120 has a 64-bit<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/multiple-core-processors-832453" >Quad-core <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.2GHz processor. The quality hardware helps ensure stable and reliable performance. The router has two USB 3.0 storage ports on the back for connecting an external hard drive.</p><p> For security, the RAX120 features WPA3 support, the ability to connect through a VPN, automatic firmware updates, and the ability to create a guest network. The RAX120 does not, however, support Netgear Armor cyber security software. It would have been nice to have the option to include some sort of software for network protection against malware.</p><p> You can enable parental controls on the router. The options are somewhat basic, but they do provide some peace of mind, and they are helpful when paired with other parental control applications.</p><p> The RAX120 is compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can use voice commands and say things like, “Alexa, ask NETGEAR to enable guest network” or “OK Google, ask NETGEAR to reboot my router.”</p><p> The router has two USB 3.0 storage ports on the back for connecting an external hard drive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Nighthawk-App"><a href="#Software-Nighthawk-App" class="headerlink" title="Software: Nighthawk App"></a><strong>Software: Nighthawk App</strong></h2><p> In the Nighthawk app, you can change your router’s settings, create a guest network, control your router remotely, manage your devices individually, and you can test your network speeds.

But it’s still on the higher end of the price spectrum, especially considering it doesn’t include any sort of mesh points, and you only get the router, power supply, and an Ethernet cable.</p><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-RAX120-vs-TP-Link-Archer-AX6000"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-RAX120-vs-TP-Link-Archer-AX6000" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 vs. TP-Link Archer AX6000"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 vs. TP-Link Archer AX6000</strong></h2><p> More and more Wi-Fi 6 routers continue to hit the market, including the TP-Link Archer AX6000 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AX6000-8-Stream-Smart-Router/dp/B07L56SN8Mhttps:/www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AX6000-8-Stream-Smart-Router/dp/B07L56SN8Mhttps:/www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AX6000-8-Stream-Smart-Router/dp/B07L56SN8M/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4942498%7Cn31dea18fa28a4d9a88e5e3a62470a49720%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ). Like the Nighthawk RAX120, the Archer AX6000 has a quad-core processor, but the Nighthawk’s processor is 2.2 GHz, while the TP-Link Archer’s CPU is only 1.8 GHz. The Nighthawk features the WPA3 security protocol, while the Archer AX6000 does not yet have WPA3. The Nighthawk RAX120 doesn’t outshine the Archer in every area though. The TP-Link Archer AX6000 has eight<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-lan-4684071" >LAN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, includes antivirus protection, has better integration with smart home platforms, and it costs $100 less.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A cool looking router that’s faster and more powerful than you probably need.</strong></p><p> The Nighthawk RAX120 performs impressively, but it‘s costly and lacks some user-friendly features like strong parental controls and easy-to-manage antivirus, so it’ll be more desirable for those with heavier networking demands than the average user.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

It offers information on seemingly everything from pace and speed to your averages, your cadence, how much power you’re pushing through your legs, and so forth. It also has many training plans that you can simply pick out and follow without needing to sign up for any additional services.</p><p> The Garmin Forerunner 265 keeps you on track outside of your training sessions. As any avid runner will know, a marathon or half-marathon plan is just as dependent on rest days as it is on active running.</p><p> The Garmin Forerunner 265 is effectively like having a personal trainer on your wrist.</p><p> That’s where the Garmin Body Battery feature is hugely useful. It gives you a score each day so you can see how far you can push things or whether you should be resting. Based on your heart rate variability, stress levels, sleep quality, and how active you’ve been, I’ve found it fairly accurate. Combined with a plan that reminds you to rest, it’s effectively like having a personal trainer on your wrist.</p><p> It’s not the most stylish of watches, but the Garmin Forerunner 265 is fantastic for pure running.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, Tom’s Guide, The Verge, and Trusted Reviews strongly recommend the Garmin Forerunner 265.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Forerunner 265 has 277 ratings from Amazon customers. 85% of those gave it five stars, with another 6% giving it four stars for an overall average of 4.6 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Also-Great"><a href="#Also-Great" class="headerlink" title="Also Great"></a>Also Great</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SUUNTO-Dual-Band-Touchscreen-Training-Insights/dp/B0CFT1CC3J?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0CFT1CC3J" >Suunto Race GPS Sports Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rMMOguoEFoyPIXnHr8NMWtxSqdM=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SuuntoRaceGPS1-9c858a97203d4694af5090e8195587ea.jpg" >Suunto Race GPS Watch. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SUUNTO-Dual-Band-Touchscreen-Training-Insights/dp/B0CFT1CC3J?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0CFT1CC3J" >https://www.amazon.com/SUUNTO-Dual-Band-Touchscreen-Training-Insights/dp/B0CFT1CC3J?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0CFT1CC3J <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SUUNTO-Dual-Band-Touchscreen-Training-Insights/dp/B0CFT1CC3J?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0CFT1CC3J" >$449 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> One of the more stylish running watches, the Sunnto Race has a great display for glancing at while you race.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Sunnto Race is a bit big on my slender wrist but it still looks good. It has an incredibly crisp display that I found instantly likeable as I ran. I might not run fast but it’s still useful to quickly glance at how you’re doing.</p><p> There aren’t many great pre-loaded digital watch faces but what’s there is classy even if not as much fun as something like the Snoopy watch face on my Apple Watch Series 9. Best of all is its Digital Crown which is something that isn’t a surefire thing on running watches in particular.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Gorgeous display</li><li>Feels classy and expensive</li><li>Offline map support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Little sluggish to respond</li><li><strong>Garmin has better insight</strong></li></ul><p> It’s easy to scroll through the options with my preference being to check how my training progress is going and when to rest. The Suunto way of doing things isn’t as detailed as the Garmin method but it’s still more than good enough and in exchange, you get a watch that you’re more likely to want to wear on an evening out rather than solely when running.</p><p> In my time with it, the Sunnto Race had a near flawless GPS although heart rate monitoring reported a little higher than on other devices although that could be down to its placement on my wrist.</p><p> Instead of Garmin training plans, you get Suunto Coach which still helps you not overload yourself while training, but it does feel a little slower to get going than other watches. Similarly, starting an exercise takes a brief moment which is simultaneously not the end of the world but does soon grate a teensy bit.</p><p> The Sunnto Race has fantastic battery life–up to 26 days. Even with GPS running the whole time, you’ll get about 40 hours.</p><p> On a much more positive note, however, the Sunnto Race has fantastic battery life, at up to 26 days, depending on how you use it. Even with GPS running the whole time, you’ll get about 40 hours, which will suit ambitious ultra-marathon runners and more. There’s extensive offline map support, too, which is great at this price.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Road.cc, TechRadar, UltraRunner Magazine, and Tom’s Guide all recommend the Sunnto Race.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Suunto Race has 91 ratings from Amazon customers. 66% of those gave it five stars, with another 12% giving it four stars for an overall average of 4.1 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0C7GGYS7M" >Amazfit Balance Smart Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1Cr0cF5dqi9WoAWH6Ov8NwRcPW4=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazFitWatch3-613ee42b11c0405b90d777d657a47f94.jpg" >AmazFit Balance Watch. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0C7GGYS7M" >https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0C7GGYS7M <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681631%7Cn62d12a47701c4d5d8f8f52456987574503%7CB0C7GGYS7M" >$230 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> More affordable than most running watches, the Amazfit Balance looks good and covers the basics, even if it does falter in places.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Amazfit Balance looks fantastic. It’s one of the more stylish watches I’ve used and while a little chunky on my small wrists, feels like something to wear to an event as well as while running. One button on the right offers a shortcut to whatever workout you’re thinking of doing while the Digital Crown is there for interacting with the many apps that are preinstalled.</p><p> A lot of these are filler material but I appreciated the meditation app. There’s a body measurement app too but like many others (including those on pricier models), this won’t really compare with a good pair of smart scales. It’s nice insight though.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Surprisingly lightweight</li><li>Looks great</li><li>Reasonably accurate</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Not as robust as some</li><li>Body measurement tools can be inaccurate</li></ul><p> The bright and crisp screen is perfect while you run. There’s no convoluted data here so at a glance, I could see exactly how fast I was moving. The only annoyance was how as standard, the watch’s voice assistant will read out your progress which can be awkward if you’re running past someone and didn’t realize it would do that (from harsh experience!).</p><p> There’s no fancy Gorilla Glass here but when running, I’m not really planning on scraping my arm alongside a rough surface so this is only really an issue if you also plan on strength training or rock climbing.</p><p> The Amazfit Balance might lack some finer details but it still squeezes in a daily readiness reading which felt akin to what Fitbits have provided in recent times. It’s not as detailed as something like Garmin’s Body Battery tool but it felt reasonably accurate when I compared it to how I was feeling.</p><p> Away from the watch, the Zepp companion app is a little confusing to use but certainly packed with functionality so it’s worth exploring.</p><p> Ultimately, the Amazfit Balance won’t compete with the big guns but it’s considerably cheaper than those options. If you’re looking for compromise, the Amazfit Balance gets the balance right.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Wired, Livescience, and ZDNet all recommend the Amazfit Balance.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The AmazFit Balance has 220 ratings from Amazon customers. 68% of those gave it five stars, with another 18% giving it four stars for an overall average of 4.5 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=195080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrwonder/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >With Screensaver Wonder you can easily make a screensaver from your own pictures and video files.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-ChatGPT-Interaction-Read-Digest-and-Summarize-PDFs-with-Ease"><a href="#Mastering-ChatGPT-Interaction-Read-Digest-and-Summarize-PDFs-with-Ease" class="headerlink" title="Mastering ChatGPT Interaction: Read, Digest, and Summarize PDFs with Ease"></a>Mastering ChatGPT Interaction: Read, Digest, and Summarize PDFs with Ease</h2><p> ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful tool that can do amazing things with text. It can summarize articles, advise on the structure and content of writing, and compose emails, to name a few.</p><p> However, it can be clumsy when it comes to dealing with file formats like PDFs. This makes it tricky if you want it to work with content in this format. If you are struggling to get ChatGPT to read PDFs, here are some easy ways to do it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues. Karaoki includes an advanced automatic singer rotation list with singer history, key control, news ticker, next singers screen, a song book exporter and printer, a jukebox background music player and many other features designed so you can host karaoke shows faster and easier!<br> PCDJ Karaoki (WINDOWS ONLY Professional Karaoke Software - 3 Activations)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Supply-ChatGPT-With-a-URL"><a href="#1-Supply-ChatGPT-With-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="1. Supply ChatGPT With a URL"></a>1. Supply ChatGPT With a URL</h2><p> ChatGPT can reference URLs that you supply it with. This means that if the PDF file is online, getting ChatGPT to reference it is super easy. A URL is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-key-url-elements/" >web address that comprises five key components <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We don’t need to go into detail here, all you need to know is the web address of the PDF you want to reference.</p><p> For example, say you are researching the US Constitution and need a summary of certain sections. If you find an online PDF, then getting ChatGPT to summarize it is easy. In this instance, we found a copy of the Constitution freely available on a<a class="link"   href="https://usgovernmentmanual.gov/ReadLibraryItem.ashx?SFN=HHpPD10yEeWjNpxh5LEASSgHjOH0S/X9&SF=VHhnJrOeEAnGaa/rtk/JOg==" >US Government website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Let’s say you want a summary of Article One, sections one to four. Armed with the URL of the document, you can prompt ChatGPT to summarize these sections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-response-to-pdf-query-on-the-us-constitution.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of response to PDF query on the US constitution"                ></p><p> ChatGPT will then nicely summarize the main points on the requested pages. One point of note here, there are<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/do-chatgpt-responses-have-character-or-word-limit/" >limitations to ChatGPT prompts and responses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , especially when it comes to more complex requests. So, for larger documents, it is good policy to break the task down into smaller parts.</p><h2 id="2-Copy-Text-From-the-PDF"><a href="#2-Copy-Text-From-the-PDF" class="headerlink" title="2. Copy Text From the PDF"></a>2. Copy Text From the PDF</h2><p> If you have a copy of the PDF on your computer, then the easiest way is to simply copy the text you need from the PDF. In the example below, we opened a PDF copy of a MakeUseOf article about<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/" >prompting techniques for ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We used Microsoft Edge to open it, and then we highlighted the relevant text and copied it to the clipboard.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-copying-text-from-pdf-opened-in-ms-edge-1.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of copying text from PDF opened in Microsoft Edge"                ></p><p> The text can then be pasted into a ChatGPT prompt, and the desired results attained. In this case, we asked it to bullet point the main points in the text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-chatgpt-summarizing-copied-text.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT summarizing copied text"                ></p><p> As you can see, ChatGPT will easily respond to prompts with text pasted into them. Just remember not to ask too much of it in a single request. This technique will work with most applications that can open PDFs.</p><h2 id="3-Convert-the-PDF-Into-a-Text-Document"><a href="#3-Convert-the-PDF-Into-a-Text-Document" class="headerlink" title="3. Convert the PDF Into a Text Document"></a>3. Convert the PDF Into a Text Document</h2><p> ChatGPT will happily read text, after all, the beating heart of any AI chatbot is a large language model (LLM).<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >LLMs are huge text databases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that AI chatbots reference to supply human-like responses. Although PDFs contain text, they aren’t easy to edit. This makes it awkward if you want to work with this format in ChatGPT. But converting it to a more manageable format is easy.</p><p> There are numerous ways to do this, including<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/convert-pdf-to-word-google-drive/" >converting it into a Word document using Google Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There are also<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/free-online-pdf-editors-secure-private/" >plenty of online PDF editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , many of which will let you convert PDFs to text.</p><p> However, if you have Microsoft Word or a similar word processor installed, then you can simply open the file and save it as a text or word document. To demonstrate this, we will use the same article as we used in method two. The following steps walk you through the process of doing this in Word:</p><ol><li>Open Word and use the<strong>Open</strong> command and browse to the folder where the document is stored.</li><li>If the document does not appear, use the file type dropdown box and select<strong>PDF Files</strong> from the options.  <!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4665597&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pcclean.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/winutilities-box-130521.png"                      border="0"                >WinUtilities Pro</a><!-- affiliate ads end --><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-word-opening-pdf-file.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of Word opening PDF file"                ></li><li>When you open the file you will be asked to convert the document, press<strong>OK</strong> to proceed.  <!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BPDF%2BUnlocker"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/pdf-unlocker.png"                      border="0"                ></a><!-- affiliate ads end --><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-word-pdf-conversion.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of Word PDF Conversion"                ></li><li>Word will now convert and open the file, you can use the<strong>Save As</strong> command to save it as a Word or text document as preferred.</li></ol><p> Once the conversion is complete, you can copy the text directly into ChatGPT and run prompts on it to get your desired results.</p><h2 id="4-Install-and-Use-an-Extension"><a href="#4-Install-and-Use-an-Extension" class="headerlink" title="4.

Sure, you can copy the text from a PDF or convert it into a text document, but is there a simpler way to go about it? Luckily, there is. One of the easiest ways to get ChatGPT to read PDFs is to just install and use an extension.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-file-uploader-ext/becfinhbfclcgokjlobojlnldbfillpf/related" >ChatGPT File Uploader <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free-to-install Chrome Extension that allows you to upload any file, including Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, image files, and, of course, PDFs. What makes this an excellent method is just how easy it is to use.</p><p> The steps are straightforward—install the ChatGPT File Uploader to your browser, open ChatGPT, and you’ll notice a shiny, new<strong>Upload</strong> button next to the message bar at the bottom. From there, all you have to do is hit the button and choose the PDF you want to upload.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="PDFs-Don’t-Have-to-Hinder-Your-ChatGPT-Usage"><a href="#PDFs-Don’t-Have-to-Hinder-Your-ChatGPT-Usage" class="headerlink" title="PDFs Don’t Have to Hinder Your ChatGPT Usage"></a>PDFs Don’t Have to Hinder Your ChatGPT Usage</h2><p> ChatGPT is a versatile tool that can handle various text-based tasks with ease. However, when it comes to working with PDFs, it can be challenging. Thankfully, there are four easy ways to work around this obstacle.</p><p> These methods overcome ChatGPT’s limitations with PDFs, allowing it to be even more useful in various text-based tasks. The quickest method is to simply copy the text from a PDF, but just occasionally this can be problematic.

As a Free user, your access to GPT-4o is not guaranteed and is subject to availability. The term “limited access” implies usage restrictions or reduced availability during peak times.</p><p> Regardless, one thing is for certain: ChatGPT Plus users will get up to five times more messages for GPT-4o. Furthermore, Plus users can send up to 80 messages every three hours. From that, we can infer that Free users would get about 16 messages per hour on a good day. It’s not bad, but it’s quite low if you’re a heavy user.</p><p> However, all of these message rates are the best you will get. As ChatGPT becomes the crutch for more businesses and individuals, usage and availability will likely decline (temporarily) in the near future. Based on this, you’d likely want a Plus subscription to insure against crowded conditions.</p><h2 id="2-Retain-Access-to-GPT-4-Turbo"><a href="#2-Retain-Access-to-GPT-4-Turbo" class="headerlink" title="2 Retain Access to GPT-4 Turbo"></a>2 Retain Access to GPT-4 Turbo</h2><p> Benchmarks and tests revealed that GPT-4o may be faster, but GPT-4 Turbo seems more accurate in some categories. It’s difficult to confirm the criteria for this and how some of these tests have been executed, but some users have reported better results from GPT-4—especially in mathematical and programming problems. Even OpenAI admits this, and according to its text evaluation results, GPT-4T does better at DROP (​​Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs) tests.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=174416&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.easygifanimator.net/images/gif-animator.png"                      border="0"                >Easy GIF Animator is a powerful animated GIF editor and the top tool for creating animated pictures, banners, buttons and GIF videos.

Even with access to GPT-4o, Free users cannot generate images from text—all DALL-E capabilities are locked behind the subscription paywall.</p><p> We are uncertain how this will translate to Free users’ access to the GPT store, seeing as many custom GPTs rely on DALL-E.

Due to how quickly GPT-4o can understand words and context, none of that characteristic delay happens while the AI is “thinking,” making for fluid—humanlike—conversation. On top of that, you can essentially video call the AI while in Voice Mode, and it will understand visual cues and objects it sees (thanks to its vision capabilities).</p><p> This new Voice Mode is not yet generally available, but Plus users will receive it as an early access feature. If you want to use this technology before most people, you’ll need to keep your ChatGPT subscription up and running.</p><p> While OpenAI’s recent demo showed us that the feature will come with the Mac app, Voice Mode is only available now through the ChatGPT smartphone app. Features like this are why many consider the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-chatgpt-ios-app-is-better-than-website/" >ChatGPT iOS app better than the website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> OpenAI also introduced us to a ChatGPT desktop in its demo. That is undoubtedly one of the early access features paid users will enjoy, and is first coming to macOS users. There may be more cool features down the line that offer very good value propositions, and paying for Plus is the only way to be among those who use it.</p><h2 id="6-Full-Access-to-Advanced-Data-Analysis-File-Uploads-Vision-and-Web-Browsing"><a href="#6-Full-Access-to-Advanced-Data-Analysis-File-Uploads-Vision-and-Web-Browsing" class="headerlink" title="6  Full Access to Advanced Data Analysis, File Uploads, Vision, and Web Browsing"></a>6  Full Access to Advanced Data Analysis, File Uploads, Vision, and Web Browsing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screenshot-2024-05-21-at-1-17-24-pm.png"                      alt="ChatGPT plans on its website"                ></p><p> Advanced data analysis, file uploads, vision, and web browsing were once features exclusive to OpenAI’s paying customers. That has now changed, and all of these are available to Free users but with more limits. The limits include fewer prompts, fewer file uploads, and lower priority access to these services during peak hours.</p><p> For some, this has disincentivized carrying on a Plus subscription. However, you will need a subscription if you’re a heavy ChatGPT user and rely on it to understand, parse, and analyze documents and photos. Granted, these are features that many don’t use very often, but if you fall within the minority, you might want to keep your Plus sub.</p><p> Also, having full access to web browsing is super useful. ChatGPT has a knowledge cutoff, and web browsing helps bridge that knowledge gap by letting it search the web to find current information. If you use ChatGPT for tasks that require current information, you might get frustrated with a Free plan.</p><p> Frankly, all the reasons for getting a ChatGPT Plus subscription are subject to how much you use the AI. If you use it a lot, you’ll find yourself hitting the limits very often. It can be well worth the money if you can afford it and don’t mind beta-testing new OpenAI features.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-securing-a-smooth-pathway-to-share-srt-text-across-multiple-platforms/"><u>[New] In 2024, Securing a Smooth Pathway to Share SRT Text Across Multiple Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-expert-insights-on-maximizing-roi-through-effective-youtube-banner-campaigns/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Expert Insights on Maximizing ROI Through Effective YouTube Banner Campaigns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-smilescribbler-share-laughter-digitally/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  SmileScribbler  Share Laughter Digitally</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/2-ways-to-monitor-apple-iphone-13-pro-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>2 Ways to Monitor Apple iPhone 13 Pro Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-facebook-newsletter-the-most-recent-changes/"><u>2024 Approved  Facebook Newsletter - The Most Recent Changes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/3-facts-you-need-to-know-about-screen-mirroring-infinix-hot-40-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>3 Facts You Need to Know about Screen Mirroring Infinix Hot 40 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-find-your-apple-iphone-xr-current-location-of-a-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>3 Solutions to Find Your Apple iPhone XR Current Location of a Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-track-apple-iphone-7-without-app-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 7 without App | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/ae-lifesavers-budget-friendly-template-assortment-for-2024/"><u>AE Lifesavers  Budget-Friendly Template Assortment for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/deciphering-access-rites-to-meta-social-network-governance/"><u>Deciphering Access Rites to Meta Social Network Governance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/essential-list-of-top-10-costless-apps-for-srt-files/"><u>Essential List of Top 10 Costless Apps for Srt Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-asus-rog-phone-8-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Change Asus ROG Phone 8 Lock Screen Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-intercept-text-messages-on-apple-iphone-6s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone 6s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-a-lost-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max for Free?

It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking.

Keep Your Whereabouts Private With <u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></h2><p>Google surely understands that some users are uncomfortable sharing their whereabouts with the platform. That’s why you’re given the option to turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone. However, take note that doing so might gravely affect the functionality of some Google products. If you don’t want it to happen, there’s an alternative solution you can try. Rather than denying Google access to your location, why not change it instead and register a fake one? Yes. That can absolutely help you conceal your whereabouts without compromising the quality of Google services. Don’t worry. It’s a piece of cake. Wondershare Dr.Fone can help you a lot in this regard. It has a potent Virtual Location feature capable of modifying your whereabouts and simulating GPS movements. Do you want to try it now? Here’s a short guide for you.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>official website.</u></a> Subsequently, install it on your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Launch the newly installed software on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your Android smartphone using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions to make sure that the connection between the two devices is stable enough to handle the succeeding procedures.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the left-side panel and then click <strong>Toolbox.</strong> On the main dashboard, click <strong>Virtual Location.</strong> Is it your first time accessing this feature?

That’s totally fine. If you’re one of them, this article can help you turn off Google location tracking on your Android device. Is there a more conservative approach to address this issue?

And for that, there is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an app that allows you to not only track Your Apple iPhone SE (2022) location but rings in with several other handy features.</p><p>Billed as the ultimate software for parental control, <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows PC and MAC OS and is easily accessible from any web browser.

After selecting the right plan for your needs, you will have to register the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100202731.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-register the software"                ></p><p>Step 2.

Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely. However, with the increase in modern mobile technology, there are several apps that can help you track your lost cell phone’s whereabouts. But you’ve already paid a premium price for your cell phone, so what you really should do is learn how to track a lost phone for free?</p><p>And if you haven’t done so already, you should also install apps whether paid or free that do more than GPS location tracking such as monitoring incoming and outgoing calls, text and multimedia messages. So if you’re wondering how to track your lost phone for free, we’ve got a few solutions that will help you do just that, and others that bring to the table a wide range of great features.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?"></a>Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?</h2><p>One of the noteworthy features of iPhones is that they tend to retain great value for many years to come hence they become a preferred choice for prying thieves. Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your Apple iPhone SE (2022) can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.</p><p>But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.</p><p>Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your Apple iPhone SE (2022), tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080421681564.jpeg"                      alt="track your lost phone for free with iCloud"                ></p><p>Step 2. Now it’s time to hit the cloud—iCloud we mean! First things first—head to &lt;<a href="http://www.iCloud.com>">www.iCloud.com&gt;</a> from any browser and login with your credentials. From the dashboard, click on Find iPhone in the second row and enter your Apple ID and password if prompted. Since you may have several Apple devices connected with the same iCloud account, click on All Devices at the top, and select the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device you wish to track from the dropdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422049397.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for free-click on Find iPhone and All Devices"                ></p><p>Step 3. That’s really all there is to it! Once you select your device, you can do one of three things—play sound, activate lost mode or erase the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device to prevent compromise of information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422409247.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for frees-start to track"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?</h2><p>If you’ve misplaced your Android cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device), and locations services on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with. Here’s how to track your lost phone with Google’s ADM.</p><p>Step 1. Most latest Android phones are already equipped with the Find My Service, but if you’re missing it, you can download it from the Google Play Store. Click start, tap security, and then device administration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422869617.jpeg"                      alt="Track Lost Android Mobile Location with Google’s ADM-install Find My Service"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, tap Find My Device, and check the box besides it.

If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?"></a>Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?</h2><p>When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions.

Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode.

For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps.

But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons.

It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way?

All the credit goes to science and the new technologies of information applied in modern society, and even governmental entities can know where you are at any moment through a cell phone number but the answer to the question about track phone by number is yes, you can.</p><p>Here, we need to mention that it depends upon the tool that you would use, whether it will work with the internet or it can provide location detail without internet access. The reason is that some of these applications need internet access to work online.</p><p>Also, each Android device is linked to a Google account, and the Internet giant offers a service called Device Manager. If you have enabled this service, then it is possible to track your mobile through the Gmail account from a computer or other devices. Also, in case of lost or stealth of an iPhone, using the “Search my iPhone” option&#x2F; app on our iOS devices, you can track the phone by number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Hack-a-Phone-Using-Number-to-track-Its-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Hack-a-Phone-Using-Number-to-track-Its-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Hack a Phone Using Number to track Its Location"></a>Part 2: How to Hack a Phone Using Number to track Its Location</h2><p>Years ago, locating a cell phone and tracking a device by hacking was not possible except for government agencies and state security agencies. The mobile locator is a triangulation with telephone antennas whose technique is based on seeing the response time of the smartphone with these antennas.

Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone SE (2022), the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone SE (2022) via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone SE (2022) in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone SE (2022), you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone SE (2022) from whoever has the phone.

Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.</p><ol><li>Firstly, just go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php" >Map Developers circle tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any supported browser like Google Chrome.

After entering all the needed details, click on the “New Circle” button and it will be reflected on Google Maps interface.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-3.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 3"                ></p><p>If you want, you can later delete this circle or draw multiple circles in different colors to mark them in any location of your choice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps"></a>Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps</h2><p>Apart from drawing a circle or radius on Google Maps, a lot of people would like to specify its distance as well. For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.</p><ul><li><em>Map Developers Radius</em></li></ul><p>Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above.

This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.</p><p>The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your Apple iPhone SE (2022) with ease.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?"></a>Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, the following methods can be used to stop someone from tracking your device</p><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)"></a>1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)</h3><p>This is a tool that you can use to change the virtual location of your device(iOS or Android).

In case you do not live in this country but still, you need to track your kid’s device, do not doubt, use one of our iPhone monitoring apps for any emergency case and protect your kids from unwarranted exposure.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-crafting-compelling-ad-messages-a-3-phase-copywriting-guide/"><u>[New] Crafting Compelling Ad Messages  A 3 Phase Copywriting Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-tools-to-replay-ps3-classics-on-pc-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Tools to Replay PS3 Classics on PC for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-screen-capture-io-screener-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Screen Capture  IO Screener Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-instantaneous-screen-logger-for-chrome-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Instantaneous Screen Logger for Chrome for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-typographic-tactics-for-advanced-ae-users/"><u>[Updated] Typographic Tactics for Advanced AE Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-easy-to-follow-guide-to-time-lapse-phenomena-with-gopro/"><u>2024 Approved  Easy-to-Follow Guide to Time-Lapse Phenomena with GoPro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-3-step-guide-to-exceptional-gopro-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  The 3-Step Guide to Exceptional GoPro Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-find-your-apple-iphone-xs-current-location-of-a-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>3 Solutions to Find Your Apple iPhone XS Current Location of a Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-track-apple-iphone-13-without-app-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 13 without App | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/download-and-update-amd-radeon-rx-580-graphics-card-drivers-simple-steps/"><u>Download and Update AMD Radeon RX 580 Graphics Card Drivers: Simple Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-apple-iphone-12-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Apple iPhone 12 mini | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-apple-iphone-6-location-by-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track Apple iPhone 6 Location by Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-apple-iphone-12-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Apple iPhone 12 Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-apple-iphone-12-pro-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Apple iPhone 12 Pro Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-apple-iphone-13-mini-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Apple iPhone 13 mini Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-i-stop-someone-from-tracking-my-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max?

But what if you don’ have the app installed? Does that mean that you have to bid adieu to your Apple iPhone SE (2022) forever? Not really, because we are about to reveal to you 5 different ways to track your Apple iPhone SE (2022) without app, so you can hopefully find your phone in the condition it went astray.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue"><a href="#Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue"></a>Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue</h2><p>Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.</p><p>Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg"                      alt="sign in to iCloud"                ></p><p>If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg"                      alt="skip the two factor authentication process"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg"                      alt="head to the quick access link"                ></p><p>Step 2.

Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png"                      alt="head to the Google Timeline to track your Apple iPhone SE (2022)"                ></p><p>Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.</p><p>Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.</p><p>Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022"><a href="#Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone SE (2022)"></a>Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone SE (2022)</h2><p>If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.</p><p>This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your Apple iPhone SE (2022), and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.</p><p>Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075191479909.jpg"                      alt="Use Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone SE (2022)"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing"><a href="#Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing"></a>Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing</h2><p>This method requires that you have Find My Friend enabled on both your missing iPhone and the one you’re going to use to track it. Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device.</p><p>Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.</p><p>Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.</p><p>Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your Apple iPhone SE (2022) and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.</p><p>Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075192666907.jpg"                      alt="use another phone to track the missing one"                ></p><p>Step 4.

Here are the answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding this topic from the internet:</p><ol><li><strong>How do I export WhatsApp chats to legal documents?</strong></li></ol><p>To export WhatsApp chats to legal documents, you need to open WhatsApp on your device. Now locate the conversation you want to export and tap the three-dots option from the top right corner. From the ensuing menu options, select “More” and press “Export Chat.” You will be presented with options to include or exclude media in the export. Select the desired option to export the chat.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device without physical access?</strong></li></ol><p>No, tracking WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device requires physical access to that device. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted for all users. This means that they are only accessible on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device where the account was registered. To track someone’s WhatsApp messages, you would generally need to install monitoring software. Along with that, you should gain physical access to their device to set up monitoring tools.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages if they are backed up on iCloud?</strong></li></ol><p>WhatsApp provides users with the option to back up their chat history to iCloud. While these backups can help restore chats, they are not designed for real-time tracking purposes. To access the conversations in the backup files, you will need to use a tool or service with decryption capabilities. It is due to the fact that WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, tracking WhatsApp messages can be helpful in various scenarios.

We know that tracking a cell phone without them knowing is illegal, but when it comes to our children’s safety we have to do this at any cost.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-essential-strategies-for-finding-fabulous-and-free-images-on-pexels/"><u>[New] In 2024, Essential Strategies for Finding Fabulous and Free Images on Pexels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unlocking-instagram-success-4-looping-video-strategies/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlocking Instagram Success  4 Looping Video Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-essential-obs-setup-for-underperforming-pcs/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Essential OBS Setup for Underperforming PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-advanced-strategies-for-logging-lol-contests/"><u>[Updated] Advanced Strategies for Logging LOL Contests</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-quick-fixes-to-resume-paused-stream-on-facebook/"><u>[Updated] Quick Fixes to Resume Paused Stream on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-comprehensive-laptop-screenrec-users-handbook/"><u>[Updated] The Comprehensive Laptop ScreenRec User's Handbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-master-the-art-of-changing-windows-11-backgrounds/"><u>2024 Approved  Master the Art of Changing Windows 11 Backgrounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-find-your-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-current-location-of-a-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>3 Solutions to Find Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Current Location of a Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-track-apple-iphone-14-plus-without-app-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 14 Plus without App | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/9-best-phone-monitoring-apps-for-apple-iphone-xr-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>9 Best Phone Monitoring Apps for Apple iPhone XR | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/best-anti-tracker-software-for-apple-iphone-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Best Anti Tracker Software For Apple iPhone 8 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/connecting-through-tunes-a-guide-to-using-spotify-together-with-loved-ones/"><u>Connecting Through Tunes: A Guide to Using Spotify Together with Loved Ones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/easy-guide-to-downloading-and-installing-hp-m428fdw-driver-works-on-windows-11-10-and-ept-7/"><u>Easy Guide to Downloading and Installing HP M428fdw Driver - Works on Windows 11, 10 & Ept-7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-apple-iphone-7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Apple iPhone 7 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-detect-and-remove-spyware-on-apple-iphone-15-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 15?

For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=11224199&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/copy_boxshot_lyricvideo.png"                      border="0"                >Lyric Video Creator Professional Version</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services. That’s indeed beneficial to all of us, especially in today’s ever-changing world. But definitely, it’s not possible if Google doesn’t have adequate location information from the pool of its users. Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products? If so, you can start by giving Google access to the location data on your Android smartphone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Top 4 Techniques to Turn Off Google Location Tracking on Android</h2><p>There’s no denying that Google uses location information to give us the best experience possible. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean there is no risk at all. We cannot rule out the possibility of data breaches and disclosure of location information that is supposed to be private. If you’re worried about this kind of situation, you can prevent it from happening in a snap of a finger. Check out the four methods below on how to turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-off-the-location-services-on-your-Android-mobile-device"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-off-the-location-services-on-your-Android-mobile-device" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn off the location services on your Android mobile device"></a>Method 1: Turn off the location services on your Android mobile device</h3><p>“How to stop Google from tracking me?” Well, it’s actually very easy.

Make sure that you are browsing privately on your device and that no one is watching you somewhere. Is there a feasible way to protect yourself from this kind of cyber intrusion?

Well, there are lots of possibilities, and most of them can directly affect you. Information pertaining to the websites you visit on the internet is mostly used by third-party partners for research and advertising. Hackers sell it to them, along with other sensitive information embedded in your browser. Of course, nobody wants that. It’s clearly an invasion of privacy. Therefore, install anti-tracker software on your device to prevent this kind of situation from happening.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="It-prevents-advertisers-from-using-your-private-information"><a href="#It-prevents-advertisers-from-using-your-private-information" class="headerlink" title="It prevents advertisers from using your private information"></a>It prevents advertisers from using your private information</h3><p>It is nice if the ads that show up while we’re browsing include products we’re personally interested in. Hence, we cannot deny that giving legitimate advertisers access to our preferences is somehow beneficial to a certain degree. However, there are some third-party affiliates that are quite aggressive in tracking our browsing data. We should get rid of that the moment we spot them red-handed. It’s best to use anti-tracker software just to be sure.</p><h3 id="It-protects-us-from-internet-scams"><a href="#It-protects-us-from-internet-scams" class="headerlink" title="It protects us from internet scams"></a>It protects us from internet scams</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-3.JPG"                      alt="internet scam frauds"                ></p><p>Identity theft is one. But to tell you, internet fraud scams come in a variety of forms. Although each of them differs at some point, most of the attacks start from stolen information. That’s why you should do everything in your power to keep your data secure and private. Don’t let anyone get access to it as though your personal details are public materials. Start by being cautious when you share confidential information online. Before you give them out, make sure that the transaction and the website involved are legitimate. Another thing, install anti-tracker software on your device and activate it whenever you go online.

This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.</p><p>The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your Apple iPhone SE (2022) with ease.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?"></a>Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, the following methods can be used to stop someone from tracking your device</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)"></a>1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)</h3><p>This is a tool that you can use to change the virtual location of your device(iOS or Android).

You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device.

It has a potent Virtual Location feature capable of modifying your whereabouts and simulating GPS movements. Do you want to try it now?

But real spy work actually happens behind a computer screen. In the age of information technology, people keep all their most valuable information stored on phones. As such, if you have access to someone’s phone, you have access to all their secrets. However, breaking into someone’s phone doesn’t require years of hacking and coding practice as most people believe. All you need is a decent app that can take care of everything for you. <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that app.</p><p>While there are a lot of other spy apps out there worth browsing through, both for Android and <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/track/iphone-monitoring.html" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, mSpy is the most reliable, reasonable, and feature-heavy of them all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14830056776035.jpg"                      alt="best spy watches"                ></p><h3 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h3><ol><li>It comes with a lot of <a class="link"   href="https://www.mspy.com/features.html" >features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4. Background Noises"></a><strong>4. Background Noises</strong></h4><p>When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone SE (2022) in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant.

It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.</p><p>Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Shows available parking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723711372.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Google Maps"                ></p><p>URL is not available yet.</p><h2 id="Option-5-Waze"><a href="#Option-5-Waze" class="headerlink" title="Option 5: Waze"></a>Option 5: Waze</h2><p>Introduction: This app, compatible with Android and iOS is intended for users who go by car.</p><p>It allows to obtain routes and check movements in real time, besides visualizing possible obstacles in your way.</p><p>The application goes beyond navigation because it permits drivers to share road reports on accidents, police checks or any other danger along their way and get information about what is coming also.

Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this.

Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device knowing they are being monitored.

It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking.

This app comes with the facility to get a notification when the target person arrives or leaves a place. Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p>Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone. To enable share my location, open the app “Find my friends” &gt; Go for the contact’s photo &gt; “Share my location”.</p><p>Step 2: Generally iCloud account has sharing options for all other devices. We have to ensure the sharing option is correctly viewed as the target device such as “This device”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100182891050.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-share my location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now swipe from bottom to end, click on the “Airdrop” option from the settings. You will have two options such as “Everyone” and “Contacts only”.</p><p>Step 4: Move to the target device, in the “Find my friends” app click the option “add”. Now your contact picture will get displayed. Click on your profile photo &gt; select the option “Share indefinitely” to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183209840.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-Share indefinitely"                ></p><p>Step 5: The target device location will be shared with you.

What is rooting? Does it have a warranty? Any rooting between Android and mSpy?</strong></p><p>Rooting is obviously known as the control between Android users and Android subsystems. It has a warranty period and rooting is applicable if you track WhatsApp, Facebook messages.</p><p><strong>2. How one can detect the software to monitor on an Android device?</strong></p><p>mSpy is authorized and certified software and it has to run legally on both user and the target device. If the illegal process is found, you can assist customer support immediately.</p><p><strong>3. If the phone was stolen, can I find My Apple iPhone SE (2022) using the number?</strong></p><p>mSpy activates if installed on the iPhone completely. The process of finding the phone using a number is not applicable in mSpy.</p><p>We must tell you using mSpy and FlexiSPY are both one of the best methods to track a cell phone. Both the applications have several metrics and would certainly assist in how to track a cell phone without them knowing.
