If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?"></a>Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?</h2><p>When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy"                ></p><p>1. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.</p><p>2. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.</p><p>3. Go to its Settings &gt; Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600151360.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-download from Unknown Sources"                ></p><p>4. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.</p><p>5. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.</p><p>6. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600392625.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-access its web-based dashboard"                ></p><p>Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?"></a>Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?</h2><p>As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – <a class="link"   href="https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/" >KidsGuard Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Furthermore, you can simply visit the desired section from the left panel to get in-depth access.

But real spy work actually happens behind a computer screen. In the age of information technology, people keep all their most valuable information stored on phones. As such, if you have access to someone’s phone, you have access to all their secrets. However, breaking into someone’s phone doesn’t require years of hacking and coding practice as most people believe. All you need is a decent app that can take care of everything for you. <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that app.</p><p>While there are a lot of other spy apps out there worth browsing through, both for Android and <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/track/iphone-monitoring.html" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, mSpy is the most reliable, reasonable, and feature-heavy of them all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14830056776035.jpg"                      alt="best spy watches"                ></p><h3 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h3><ol><li>It comes with a lot of <a class="link"   href="https://www.mspy.com/features.html" >features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.</p><p>The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your Apple iPhone 14 Plus with ease.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?"></a>Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, the following methods can be used to stop someone from tracking your device</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982596">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982596">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982596%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982596/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)"></a>1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)</h3><p>This is a tool that you can use to change the virtual location of your device(iOS or Android).

This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features.

A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.</p><p>It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?</h2><p>The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037346/7443" target="_top" id="2037346">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037346" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037346/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4. Background Noises"></a><strong>4. Background Noises</strong></h4><p>When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone 15 Plus in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-best-gear-for-comprehensively-filmed-action/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Best Gear for Comprehensively Filmed Action</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/2-ways-to-monitor-apple-iphone-se-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>2 Ways to Monitor Apple iPhone SE Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/active-directory-down-print-operation-fails/"><u>Active Directory Down - Print Operation Fails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/connect-and-control-how-to-use-your-android-phone-as-a-remote-for-firestick/"><u>Connect and Control: How To Use Your Android Phone as a Remote For Firestick</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/easy-steps-to-recover-deleted-music-from-moto-g13-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/"><u>Easy steps to recover deleted music from Moto G13</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/gameplay-chronicles-proven-techniques-for-recording-your-sims-epic-saga-in-sims-4-for-2024/"><u>Gameplay Chronicles Proven Techniques for Recording Your Sim's Epic Saga in Sims 4 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-intercept-text-messages-on-apple-iphone-13-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone 13 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-after-switching-from-samsung-galaxy-f54-5g-to-latest-samsung-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data After Switching From Samsung Galaxy F54 5G to Latest Samsung | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-off-google-location-to-stop-tracking-you-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Apple iPhone 11 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-best-phone-monitoring-apps-for-apple-iphone-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 9 Best Phone Monitoring Apps for Apple iPhone 8 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-hassle-free-ways-to-remove-frp-lock-on-xiaomi-redmi-13c-phones-withwithout-a-pc-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Xiaomi Redmi 13C Phones with/without a PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-apple-iphone-se-location-without-installing-software-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Track Apple iPhone SE Location without Installing Software? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-7-phone-number-locators-to-track-apple-iphone-6-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 7 Phone Number Locators To Track Apple iPhone 6 Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/no-more-disruptions-expert-advice-on-preventing-state-of-decay-2-crashes/"><u>No More Disruptions: Expert Advice on Preventing State of Decay 2 Crashes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/strategies-to-improve-seamless-broadcasts-in-obs/"><u>Strategies to Improve Seamless Broadcasts in OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/top-4-ways-to-trace-apple-iphone-6s-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Top 4 Ways to Trace Apple iPhone 6s Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/two-ways-to-track-my-boyfriends-apple-iphone-6s-without-him-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Two Ways to Track My Boyfriends Apple iPhone 6s without Him Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

While cellphones are meant to give everyone the ability to communicate, their secretive nature can also nurture society’s ills, and children, especially teenagers can fall prey to these. Yet, as a parent, it can be very hard to monitor what your child is doing on your device. That’s why we thought it wise to share with you a few ways you can spy on someone’s text messages from your device or computer.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-another-Android-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-another-Android-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on text messages from another Android phone"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on text messages from another Android phone</h2><p>To spy on another android device’s text messages, you will need to install spy software on that device. One of the best monitoring programs for the task is eyeZy. It is affordable, easy to install, and above all gives you access to the target device’s text messages remotely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.eyezy.com/" >EyeZy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can also provide you with a wealth of other information about the target device including call history, browsing history, and even GPS location.</p><p>Here’s how to spy on another Android device’s text messages using eyeZy.</p><p>Step 1: The first step is to register for an eyeZy account on the eyeZy website. You can choose to purchase a 1 monthly&#x2F;3 monthly&#x2F;12 monthly subscription.</p><p>Step 2: Once you’ve registered and paid for your account, you will receive an email with all the information to help you download and install the software.

You can also see both sent and received messages.</p><p>Here’s how to use Auto Forward to spy on another iPhone’s text messages.</p><p>Step 1: To begin with, download and install Auto Forward onto your computer or another iOS device.</p><p>Step 2: Log in to your account (that you would have created before installing the app) and enter the Apple ID and password of the iPhone you want to spy on.</p><p>Step 3: The app will automatically access all messages on the target device.

The whole device folds up into a very small package, just 2.5” wide, 1.25” tall, and 1.5” wide, so you can tuck it into a pocket. When you open it up, the flexible design is simple to position. Unfolded, the webcam has three pieces: the base, neck, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-digital-cameras-under-100-3897833" >camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The base is the heaviest part, which means that the camera stays upright even if you don’t perfectly balance everything. The top is made out of a soft, rubbery plastic, and the bottom has a rubbery dot that keeps the base from sliding around. The dot comes off the base to reveal a tripod post, so this camera is compatible with a standard tripod. The only problem is that the dot comes off completely when the tripod post is exposed. If you’re prone to losing things, this may be an issue.</p><p> The thoughtful design, image quality, and microphone clarity easily justify the price tag.</p><p> The base’s rubbery surface kept the Logitech C615 From sliding around when we mounted it on our HD TV, even when we moved the USB cable around. The neck is a thin plastic piece that has a lip for mounting the camera to an LCD TV or computer monitor. There are also two rubber strips on the sides to keep it from sliding back and forth when mounted.</p><p> The camera section is made of black plastic with a cropped silver plastic circle around the lens. To the left of the lens there’s an indicator light to show when the camera is on, and the microphone sits to the right of the lens. The 360 swivel not only makes the Logitech C615 easy to position, it also makes it possible to fold the camera lens in on itself to protect it on the go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jgQ_lVlvzgmXFPpBg5nEd6pgV_c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_12_Final_Horiz-e97c48d3af6842eb88775a9d703ce2b6.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles</strong></h2><p> The camera takes 1080p video and has a 2 MP sensor. We tested the webcam’s photo capabilities by taking a picture of some packaging. Color was well represented, but the autofocus was just a bit off. The image was just a bit blurry, and we couldn’t read the smaller words at all. This wasn’t a problem close up, but it made a bigger difference when people were far away.</p><p> Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow.</p><p> The autofocus also had trouble when there was an object between the camera and the people on which we wanted to focus it. It worked best when we pointed the camera at the background. When a person walked into the shot, the autofocus detected the person and focused on him. When there was a little glare in the background of the shot, the C615 completely blew out those highlights, showing only a bright white light. If you’re going to use this in a fluorescent office with steady, even light it won’t be a problem. Annoying for video chat, but a big problem if you’re using it for YouTube or streaming your game feed.</p><p> The video is 1080p, and looks it. Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow, though it does suffer from some minor depth of field issues when multiple people are in frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Bko9Uk1HIIMt9aNgtBf9ATCy0AA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_14_Final_Horiz-4f1b9fe91b8c4229b17dbbe6afb81b8c.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014848/22899" target="_top" id="2014848">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014848" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014848/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic"><a href="#Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic"></a><strong>Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic</strong></h2><p> We used both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test the performance of the C615. It was very easy to position the camera exactly the way we wanted it, though the USB cable occasionally gave us problems. We’d swivel the camera and then the pull of the USB cable would turn the whole base so the camera pointed back at the same spot where it started.</p><p> When we used Skype to make calls everything worked great. The HD camera made the video look great, and video and sound were in sync. Close up, the sound was clear but with a thin, distorted tone. From 10 feet away, we heard only a small amount of echo in the call. We also tried using the camera mic with video game noise in the background.

Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p>Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone. To enable share my location, open the app “Find my friends” &gt; Go for the contact’s photo &gt; “Share my location”.</p><p>Step 2: Generally iCloud account has sharing options for all other devices. We have to ensure the sharing option is correctly viewed as the target device such as “This device”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100182891050.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-share my location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075472/7443" target="_top" id="2075472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075472/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3: Now swipe from bottom to end, click on the “Airdrop” option from the settings.

This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.</p><p>You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do people track your phone?"></a>Part 1: How do people track your phone?</h2><p>There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.</p><p>The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro with ease.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?"></a>Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, the following methods can be used to stop someone from tracking your device</p><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)"></a>1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)</h3><p>This is a tool that you can use to change the virtual location of your device(iOS or Android).

It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps.

So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.</p><p><strong>Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones</strong></p><p>To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2. Install the application</strong></p><p>After you have received the installation procedures, install <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the target device which will take a few minutes. Once the application is set up, it is going to work invisibly and the target user will never get to know that he is being monitored. The target phone will work normally and mSpy will not interfere in any of the applications installed on the target phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781234928456.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install the application"                ></p><p>Installing in Android</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781239566126.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing in Android"                ></p><p>Installing on iOS</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781241065208.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing on iOS"                ></p><p><strong>3. Start monitoring</strong></p><p>You can now start intercepting the text messages remotely from other phones. Use your account through your login credentials and get reports from the target phone pertaining to text message history, chats, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781244325874.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Start monitoring"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137215/26400" target="_top" id="2137215">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137215" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137215/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The above screen is the monitoring console through which we can see all the text messages on the target device. The control panel can be opened on any device i.e. phone or computer through the browser using the login credentials.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-you-need-to-know-when-using-mSpy"><a href="#Part-3-What-you-need-to-know-when-using-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What you need to know when using mSpy"></a>Part 3: What you need to know when using mSpy</h2><p><strong>Few things to know when using <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</strong></p><p>While the working, installation, and setting up of mSpy is very easy, there are a few things that need to be kept in mind while using mSpy.</p><p>1. While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up. This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.</p><p>2. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.</p><p>So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy. Hope this helps you in successfully and safely intercepting text messages.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-honor-play-40c-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Can I use iTools gpx file to catch the rare Pokemon On Honor Play 40C | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/full-tutorial-to-bypass-your-samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-tactical-edition-face-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Full Tutorial to Bypass Your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition Face Lock?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/hdr-camera-mastery-essential-buying-tips/"><u>HDR Camera Mastery Essential Buying Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-detect-and-remove-spyware-on-apple-iphone-xs-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone XS Max? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-spy-on-text-messages-from-computer-and-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Spy on Text Messages from Computer & Apple iPhone 6 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-track-apple-iphone-14-pro-without-app-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 14 Pro without App | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-we-bypass-realme-narzo-60x-5g-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How Can We Bypass Realme Narzo 60x 5G FRP?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-apple-iphone-se-2020-location-without-installing-software-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Track Apple iPhone SE (2020) Location without Installing Software? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-turn-off-google-location-to-stop-tracking-you-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Apple iPhone 13 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-free-mov-video-combiner-software-top-picks/"><u>New 2024 Approved Free MOV Video Combiner Software Top Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/recover-your-music-after-f3-pro-has-been-deleted-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/"><u>Recover your music after F3 Pro has been deleted</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/solutions-to-spy-on-apple-iphone-13-mini-with-and-without-jailbreak-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Solutions to Spy on Apple iPhone 13 mini with and without jailbreak | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/solving-the-issue-of-inoperative-mic-on-your-steelseries-arctis-headset-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Solving the Issue of Inoperative Mic on Your SteelSeries Arctis Headset – A Step by Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/top-10-cutting-edge-electronic-presents-featured-on-zdnet/"><u>Top 10 Cutting-Edge Electronic Presents - Featured on ZDNet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/top-5-tracking-apps-to-track-apple-iphone-12-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Top 5 Tracking Apps to Track Apple iPhone 12 without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/top-7-phone-number-locators-to-track-apple-iphone-se-2022-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Top 7 Phone Number Locators To Track Apple iPhone SE (2022) Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/understanding-the-dynamics-of-night-portraits-for-2024/"><u>Understanding the Dynamics of Night Portraits for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.</p><p>You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do people track your phone?"></a>Part 1: How do people track your phone?</h2><p>There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.</p><p>The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro with ease.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="864" height="1296" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?"></a>Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, the following methods can be used to stop someone from tracking your device</p><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)"></a>1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)</h3><p>This is a tool that you can use to change the virtual location of your device(iOS or Android).

Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results.

That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-ChatGPT-Interaction-Read-Digest-and-Summarize-PDFs-with-Ease"><a href="#Mastering-ChatGPT-Interaction-Read-Digest-and-Summarize-PDFs-with-Ease" class="headerlink" title="Mastering ChatGPT Interaction: Read, Digest, and Summarize PDFs with Ease"></a>Mastering ChatGPT Interaction: Read, Digest, and Summarize PDFs with Ease</h2><p> ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful tool that can do amazing things with text. It can summarize articles, advise on the structure and content of writing, and compose emails, to name a few.</p><p> However, it can be clumsy when it comes to dealing with file formats like PDFs. This makes it tricky if you want it to work with content in this format. If you are struggling to get ChatGPT to read PDFs, here are some easy ways to do it.</p><h2 id="1-Supply-ChatGPT-With-a-URL"><a href="#1-Supply-ChatGPT-With-a-URL" class="headerlink" title="1. Supply ChatGPT With a URL"></a>1. Supply ChatGPT With a URL</h2><p> ChatGPT can reference URLs that you supply it with. This means that if the PDF file is online, getting ChatGPT to reference it is super easy. A URL is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-key-url-elements/" >web address that comprises five key components <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We don’t need to go into detail here, all you need to know is the web address of the PDF you want to reference.</p><p> For example, say you are researching the US Constitution and need a summary of certain sections. If you find an online PDF, then getting ChatGPT to summarize it is easy. In this instance, we found a copy of the Constitution freely available on a<a class="link"   href="https://usgovernmentmanual.gov/ReadLibraryItem.ashx?SFN=HHpPD10yEeWjNpxh5LEASSgHjOH0S/X9&SF=VHhnJrOeEAnGaa/rtk/JOg==" >US Government website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Let’s say you want a summary of Article One, sections one to four. Armed with the URL of the document, you can prompt ChatGPT to summarize these sections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-response-to-pdf-query-on-the-us-constitution.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of response to PDF query on the US constitution"                ></p><p> ChatGPT will then nicely summarize the main points on the requested pages. One point of note here, there are<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/do-chatgpt-responses-have-character-or-word-limit/" >limitations to ChatGPT prompts and responses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , especially when it comes to more complex requests. So, for larger documents, it is good policy to break the task down into smaller parts.</p><h2 id="2-Copy-Text-From-the-PDF"><a href="#2-Copy-Text-From-the-PDF" class="headerlink" title="2. Copy Text From the PDF"></a>2. Copy Text From the PDF</h2><p> If you have a copy of the PDF on your computer, then the easiest way is to simply copy the text you need from the PDF. In the example below, we opened a PDF copy of a MakeUseOf article about<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/prompting-techniques-to-improve-chatgpt-responses/" >prompting techniques for ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We used Microsoft Edge to open it, and then we highlighted the relevant text and copied it to the clipboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-copying-text-from-pdf-opened-in-ms-edge-1.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of copying text from PDF opened in Microsoft Edge"                ></p><p> The text can then be pasted into a ChatGPT prompt, and the desired results attained. In this case, we asked it to bullet point the main points in the text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-chatgpt-summarizing-copied-text.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT summarizing copied text"                ></p><p> As you can see, ChatGPT will easily respond to prompts with text pasted into them. Just remember not to ask too much of it in a single request. This technique will work with most applications that can open PDFs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148648/16836" target="_top" id="2148648">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148648" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148648/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Convert-the-PDF-Into-a-Text-Document"><a href="#3-Convert-the-PDF-Into-a-Text-Document" class="headerlink" title="3. Convert the PDF Into a Text Document"></a>3. Convert the PDF Into a Text Document</h2><p> ChatGPT will happily read text, after all, the beating heart of any AI chatbot is a large language model (LLM).<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-large-langauge-models-how-do-they-work/" >LLMs are huge text databases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that AI chatbots reference to supply human-like responses. Although PDFs contain text, they aren’t easy to edit. This makes it awkward if you want to work with this format in ChatGPT. But converting it to a more manageable format is easy.</p><p> There are numerous ways to do this, including<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/convert-pdf-to-word-google-drive/" >converting it into a Word document using Google Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There are also<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/free-online-pdf-editors-secure-private/" >plenty of online PDF editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , many of which will let you convert PDFs to text.</p><p> However, if you have Microsoft Word or a similar word processor installed, then you can simply open the file and save it as a text or word document. To demonstrate this, we will use the same article as we used in method two. The following steps walk you through the process of doing this in Word:</p><ol><li>Open Word and use the<strong>Open</strong> command and browse to the folder where the document is stored.</li><li>If the document does not appear, use the file type dropdown box and select<strong>PDF Files</strong> from the options.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-word-opening-pdf-file.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of Word opening PDF file"                ></li><li>When you open the file you will be asked to convert the document, press<strong>OK</strong> to proceed.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135417/19272" target="_top" id="2135417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135417/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-of-word-pdf-conversion.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of Word PDF Conversion"                ><br>4.

Sure, you can copy the text from a PDF or convert it into a text document, but is there a simpler way to go about it? Luckily, there is. One of the easiest ways to get ChatGPT to read PDFs is to just install and use an extension.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-file-uploader-ext/becfinhbfclcgokjlobojlnldbfillpf/related" >ChatGPT File Uploader <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free-to-install Chrome Extension that allows you to upload any file, including Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, image files, and, of course, PDFs. What makes this an excellent method is just how easy it is to use.</p><p> The steps are straightforward—install the ChatGPT File Uploader to your browser, open ChatGPT, and you’ll notice a shiny, new<strong>Upload</strong> button next to the message bar at the bottom. From there, all you have to do is hit the button and choose the PDF you want to upload.</p><h2 id="PDFs-Don’t-Have-to-Hinder-Your-ChatGPT-Usage"><a href="#PDFs-Don’t-Have-to-Hinder-Your-ChatGPT-Usage" class="headerlink" title="PDFs Don’t Have to Hinder Your ChatGPT Usage"></a>PDFs Don’t Have to Hinder Your ChatGPT Usage</h2><p> ChatGPT is a versatile tool that can handle various text-based tasks with ease. However, when it comes to working with PDFs, it can be challenging.

It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014850/22899" target="_top" id="2014850">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014850" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014850/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data.

So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.</p><p><strong>Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones</strong></p><p>To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2.

If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3.

We’d love to hear from you.</p><h2 id="How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-15-for-Free"><a href="#How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-15-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 15 for Free?"></a>How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 15 for Free?</h2><p>A cell phone is a rather small device when compared to other things you may haul around on a daily basis such as a purse or wallet and even a bunch of keys. Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely. However, with the increase in modern mobile technology, there are several apps that can help you track your lost cell phone’s whereabouts. But you’ve already paid a premium price for your cell phone, so what you really should do is learn how to track a lost phone for free?</p><p>And if you haven’t done so already, you should also install apps whether paid or free that do more than GPS location tracking such as monitoring incoming and outgoing calls, text and multimedia messages. So if you’re wondering how to track your lost phone for free, we’ve got a few solutions that will help you do just that, and others that bring to the table a wide range of great features.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?"></a>Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?</h2><p>One of the noteworthy features of iPhones is that they tend to retain great value for many years to come hence they become a preferred choice for prying thieves. Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your Apple iPhone 15 can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.</p><p>But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Apple iPhone 15 device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Apple iPhone 15 device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.</p><p>Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your Apple iPhone 15, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080421681564.jpeg"                      alt="track your lost phone for free with iCloud"                ></p><p>Step 2. Now it’s time to hit the cloud—iCloud we mean! First things first—head to &lt;<a href="http://www.iCloud.com>">www.iCloud.com&gt;</a> from any browser and login with your credentials. From the dashboard, click on Find iPhone in the second row and enter your Apple ID and password if prompted. Since you may have several Apple devices connected with the same iCloud account, click on All Devices at the top, and select the Apple iPhone 15 device you wish to track from the dropdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422049397.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for free-click on Find iPhone and All Devices"                ></p><p>Step 3. That’s really all there is to it! Once you select your device, you can do one of three things—play sound, activate lost mode or erase the Apple iPhone 15 device to prevent compromise of information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422409247.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for frees-start to track"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?</h2><p>If you’ve misplaced your Android cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Apple iPhone 15 device), and locations services on the Apple iPhone 15 device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with. Here’s how to track your lost phone with Google’s ADM.</p><p>Step 1. Most latest Android phones are already equipped with the Find My Service, but if you’re missing it, you can download it from the Google Play Store. Click start, tap security, and then device administration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422869617.jpeg"                      alt="Track Lost Android Mobile Location with Google’s ADM-install Find My Service"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, tap Find My Device, and check the box besides it. Tap the back button once and then again to return to the main settings menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080423235837.jpeg"                      alt="Track Lost Android Mobile Location-return to the main settings menu"                ></p><p>Step 3. To turn location services on, tap locations in the settings menu, tap mode so its turns green and then select high accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080423753576.jpeg"                      alt="Track with Google’s ADM-turn location services on"                ></p><p>Step 4. From the same window, tap Location History and turn it on and subsequently tap the button beside your device name to activate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080424126895.jpeg"                      alt="Track with Google’s ADM-activate the Apple iPhone 15 device"                ></p><p>Step 4. When you need to locate your device, type find my device in a web browser and select what usually is the first link. Enter your email and password associated with your device account, and you will be presented with a dashboard, from where you can send an audible tone to your device even if it were on silent, lock your phone or erase it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080424492002.jpeg"                      alt="Track with Google’s ADM-locate your device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Track-Mobile-Phone-via-Spyera"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Track-Mobile-Phone-via-Spyera" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Track Mobile Phone via Spyera?"></a>Part 3: How to Track Mobile Phone via Spyera?</h2><p>Sometimes however, you will want to do a lot more than track a device such as knowing if your employees are misusing your business cellular plan or your kids are sending and receiving obscene multimedia messages from different chat applications including WhatsApp. So if you’re wondering how to track a lost phone and also access these premium features, two names immediately come to mind—Spyera and mSpy.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://spyera.com/" >Spyera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an award winning software and is compatible with both Android and iOS devices.

This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.</p><p>You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do people track your phone?"></a>Part 1: How do people track your phone?</h2><p>There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.</p><p>The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro with ease.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?"></a>Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, the following methods can be used to stop someone from tracking your device</p><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)"></a>1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)</h3><p>This is a tool that you can use to change the virtual location of your device(iOS or Android).

Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.</p><ol><li>Firstly, just go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php" >Map Developers circle tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any supported browser like Google Chrome.

Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-6.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 6"                ></p><ol><li>Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu. From the available options on the context menu, click on “Measure Distance”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-7.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 7"                ></p><ol><li>Afterward, just click anywhere else on the map and it will automatically find a straight line distance in Google Maps between these two spots.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-8.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 8"                ></p><ol><li>If you want to continue, then just click anywhere else on the map and that will be considered as the next spot. Therefore, you can just click as many times as you want to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-9.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 9"                ></p><p>This technique will let you measure distance between any addresses on Google Maps. It doesn’t matter if it is your present location or not. If you want to measure distance in some other location, then just enter its name in the search bar to load it. In this way, you can measure distance anywhere in the world by sitting in your home.</p><p>This brings us to the end of this extensive guide on using Google Maps distance and radius features. As you can see, I have provided a smart and user-friendly solution to draw radius distance on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also follow the above guide to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps.
