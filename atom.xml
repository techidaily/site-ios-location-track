If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device and how to eliminate the threat. This article will help you with both.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?"></a>Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?</h2><p>The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.</p><p>It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?</h2><p>The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4. Background Noises"></a><strong>4. Background Noises</strong></h4><p>When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone 6s Plus in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-two-ways-to-track-my-boyfriends-apple-iphone-12-pro-without-him-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Two Ways to Track My Boyfriends Apple iPhone 12 Pro without Him Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-ways-to-track-apple-iphone-15-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 3 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 15 without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-ways-to-stop-parent-tracking-your-apple-iphone-14-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Ways to stop parent tracking your Apple iPhone 14 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-find-your-apple-iphone-xs-max-current-location-of-a-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>3 Solutions to Find Your Apple iPhone XS Max Current Location of a Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-intercept-text-messages-on-apple-iphone-6s-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone 6s Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-apple-iphone-12-pro-location-without-installing-software-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track Apple iPhone 12 Pro Location without Installing Software?

But there may be times when you may feel the need to get a comprehensive look or rather a mirror image of what your cell phone is being used for. And for that, there is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an app that allows you to not only track Your Apple iPhone XR location but rings in with several other handy features.</p><p>Billed as the ultimate software for parental control, <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows PC and MAC OS and is easily accessible from any web browser. It is easy to install and if you experience any hiccups, you can always refer to the free online help. Further, it is available in several countries and backed by stellar multi-language customer support. mSpy offers three unique plans to choose from, each with its rich set of features that include the ability to manage calls, track text messages, read emails, track GPS location, monitor browsing history and internet use, control apps and programs and read instant messages from the app such as WhatsApp for a grand total of 24 features.</p><p>Step 1. After selecting the right plan for your needs, you will have to register the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100202731.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-register the software"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, you will have to set up the app with information on your target device and that’s it! You can now access the mSpy dashboard and begin tracking your cell phone location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100515661.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-setup the app"                ></p><p>Step 3. You can select from several options in the left hand, two of the most noteworthy being geo-fencing and WhatsApp. Geo-fencing is a great feature to monitor both your kids and employees and basically, allows you to set up parameters and alert you when they are breached.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100786594.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-select from several options"                ></p><p>WhatsApp is a highly secure chat application, but mSpy backed by the latest technology also allows you to monitor its messages both incoming and outgoing. Simply click on the WhatsApp tab and you will be presented with a list of WhatsApp messages that you can further sort through by date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082101238393.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-sort through WhatsApp messages by date"                ></p><p>There are several instances such as in the excitement of getting a new phone that we may overlook the need to install software to track a cell phone. But both Google and Apple are generous enough to offer a solution to track your cell phone location without having to install any third-party software. But if you’re like to do a lot more than just track your cell phone’s location, mSpy with its expensive list of features sets the gold standard in this space.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-apple-iphone-7-plus-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Apple iPhone 7 Plus Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-apple-iphone-xs-location-by-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track Apple iPhone XS Location by Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-car-locator-apps-for-apple-iphone-12-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 5 Car Locator Apps for Apple iPhone 12 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-a-lost-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max for Free?

Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup"                ></p><p>Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.</p><p>Step 4: You can then log in to your <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079748088200.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-log in to your mSpy control panel"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak"></a>Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak</h2><p>Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.</p><p>Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy"                ></p><p>Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the</p><p>device will however make it easier for the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.</p><h2 id="Top-4-Ways-to-Trace-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Location"><a href="#Top-4-Ways-to-Trace-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Location" class="headerlink" title="Top 4 Ways to Trace Apple iPhone 7 Plus Location"></a>Top 4 Ways to Trace Apple iPhone 7 Plus Location</h2><p>Have you ever wondered about keeping a track of where your children and family members are, where they are going, are they safe?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Detect-and-Remove-Spyware-on-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022"><a href="#How-to-Detect-and-Remove-Spyware-on-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022" class="headerlink" title="How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone SE (2022)?"></a>How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone SE (2022)?</h2><p>As scary as it sounds, it is actually quite possible that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone SE (2022). These hackers and sometimes amateurs make use of sophisticated spy software to infiltrate your device and have access to your information. If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your Apple iPhone SE (2022), it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device and how to eliminate the threat. This article will help you with both.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?"></a>Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?</h2><p>The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.</p><p>It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?</h2><p>The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4. Background Noises"></a><strong>4. Background Noises</strong></h4><p>When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone SE (2022) in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Best-Spy-Watches-For-your-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022"><a href="#Top-10-Best-Spy-Watches-For-your-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Apple iPhone SE (2022)"></a>Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Apple iPhone SE (2022)</h2><p>If you’re looking for some hidden and discreet spy gear to take video and audio recordings without anyone knowing, or to take snapshots discreetly, then your best bet is to get a nice spy watch.

For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results.

It works by connecting our car with the mobile phone and allowing us to know at all times the location of our car, something very useful in case of missing or even theft. In addition, in case of an accident, we can notify the emergency services through the same application.</p><p>This app to find your car consists of a sensor connected to the mobile application and all we have to do is install it in the OBD (On Board Diagnostics) port of our vehicle, usually located next to the instrument control or around of the center console. It is available for iOS. Apart from looking for the car, this app allows us to control through Bluetooth also the consumption of gasoline, the effort that has made the engine, if you suffer and how to avoid it while advising us on how to achieve and maintain optimal driving.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Can receive free emergency help in case of a crash.</p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Available in English.</p><p>Compatible with iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch</p><p>Control if you need gasoline through Bluetooth</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723208344.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Automatic"                ></p><p>URL:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version"><a href="#Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)"></a>Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)</h2><p>Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.</p><p>Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Shows available parking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723711372.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Google Maps"                ></p><p>URL is not available yet.</p><h2 id="Option-5-Waze"><a href="#Option-5-Waze" class="headerlink" title="Option 5: Waze"></a>Option 5: Waze</h2><p>Introduction: This app, compatible with Android and iOS is intended for users who go by car.</p><p>It allows to obtain routes and check movements in real time, besides visualizing possible obstacles in your way.</p><p>The application goes beyond navigation because it permits drivers to share road reports on accidents, police checks or any other danger along their way and get information about what is coming also. It uses satellite technology, so it does not require internet. This application helps you to find parking areas when you need one and can be activated as a GPS locator for the car.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>It is a car locator</p><p>Thanks to GPS you can find available parking</p><p>Get information in real-time if there is any problem in the way.</p><p>It is free and very easy to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081724223630.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Waze"                ></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>So, now onwards, you do not need to pay to get a GPS locator for the car, as you can see, there are many available options that you can use and choose to locate your car for free for both iOS and Android devices.

This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.</p><p>You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do people track your phone?"></a>Part 1: How do people track your phone?</h2><p>There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.</p><p>The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your Apple iPhone 14 Pro with ease.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?"></a>Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, the following methods can be used to stop someone from tracking your device</p><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)"></a>1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)</h3><p>This is a tool that you can use to change the virtual location of your device(iOS or Android).

You need to know that you are safe all the time and this is a step that you should take when you feel like you are being tracked for nefarious reasons. However, you should do this with caution as the information can also be used in a beneficial manner. The best option is to turn on the GPS when you need it and then turn it off when you do not, or use an iOS spoofing tool.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-whatsapp-messages-on-apple-iphone-13-mini-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track WhatsApp Messages on Apple iPhone 13 mini Without Them Knowing?

For instance, text messages which are one of the most important components of every phone, can now be easily intercepted or spied on, courtesy some smart applications. Yes, it is a matter of minutes now to be able to spy on or intercept text messages even when not having the target device in your possession. Moreover, there are applications that work on all platforms whether it is android or iOS. But how do you intercept text messages? Well, if this is what’s playing in your mind; you are absolutely at the right place. In this article, we are going to discuss ways to intercept text messages from both iOS and Android Phones and how to know whether your text messages have been intercepted.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended android&#x2F;ios location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Virtual Location - the most trustworthy way to fake GPS on iPhone &#x2F;Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="fake GPS of mobile device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?"></a>Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?</h2><p>Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data. This feature helps when the phone is stolen. Installing mSpy on the target phone is extremely simple and involves very few steps. So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.</p><p><strong>Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones</strong></p><p>To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2. Install the application</strong></p><p>After you have received the installation procedures, install <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the target device which will take a few minutes. Once the application is set up, it is going to work invisibly and the target user will never get to know that he is being monitored.

If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.</p><p>So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy.

As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?"></a>Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?</h2><p>When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy"                ></p><p>1.

Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.</p><p>2. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.</p><p>3. Go to its Settings &gt; Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600151360.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-download from Unknown Sources"                ></p><p>4.

This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.</p><p>You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do people track your phone?"></a>Part 1: How do people track your phone?</h2><p>There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features. If you do not want to be tracked, then you have to find ways in which to disable these functions.</p><p>The sections below will show you how to stop someone from tracking your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with ease.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-stop-my-iPhone-from-being-tracked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?"></a>Part 2: How to stop my iPhone from being tracked?</h2><p>If you have an iPhone, the following methods can be used to stop someone from tracking your device</p><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)"></a>1) Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location(iOS&#x2F;Android)</h3><p>This is a tool that you can use to change the virtual location of your device(iOS or Android).

It is safe and will not affect the normal functioning of your device. Simply get it from Google Play Store, install it, and launch it. When it is up and running, you have to use the map interface to pin the new location that you want to teleport to. Anyone who may be tracking you will instantly be fooled that you are in the new location. You may also move around using the Joystick feature just as if you are on the ground in the teleport location.</p><p><strong>How to use Fake GPS Go</strong></p><ul><li>From the “Settings” app, navigate down to “About Phone” and then tap on “Build Number” seven times in order to enable the “Developer Options”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg"                      alt="android pokemon go spoofing 4"                ></p><ul><li>Launch Fake GPS go and the grant it the required access.

It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats.

Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2.

Start monitoring</strong></p><p>You can now start intercepting the text messages remotely from other phones. Use your account through your login credentials and get reports from the target phone pertaining to text message history, chats, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781244325874.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Start monitoring"                ></p><p>The above screen is the monitoring console through which we can see all the text messages on the target device.

This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.</p><p>2. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.</p><p>So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy.

For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us.

You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps.

Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services.

Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products? If so, you can start by giving Google access to the location data on your Android smartphone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p>Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Detect-and-Remove-Spyware-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#How-to-Detect-and-Remove-Spyware-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max?"></a>How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max?</h2><p>As scary as it sounds, it is actually quite possible that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. These hackers and sometimes amateurs make use of sophisticated spy software to infiltrate your device and have access to your information. If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and how to eliminate the threat. This article will help you with both.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?"></a>Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?</h2><p>The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.</p><p>It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?</h2><p>The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4. Background Noises"></a><strong>4. Background Noises</strong></h4><p>When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.</p><h2 id="How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Location-by-Number"><a href="#How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Location-by-Number" class="headerlink" title="How to Track Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Location by Number"></a>How to Track Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Location by Number</h2><p>If you need to know where is your partner, you can quickly locate him&#x2F;her through a GPS facility on your cell phone.

For instance, text messages which are one of the most important components of every phone, can now be easily intercepted or spied on, courtesy some smart applications. Yes, it is a matter of minutes now to be able to spy on or intercept text messages even when not having the target device in your possession. Moreover, there are applications that work on all platforms whether it is android or iOS. But how do you intercept text messages? Well, if this is what’s playing in your mind; you are absolutely at the right place. In this article, we are going to discuss ways to intercept text messages from both iOS and Android Phones and how to know whether your text messages have been intercepted.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended android&#x2F;ios location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Virtual Location - the most trustworthy way to fake GPS on iPhone &#x2F;Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="fake GPS of mobile device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?"></a>Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?</h2><p>Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats.

Here are the answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding this topic from the internet:</p><ol><li><strong>How do I export WhatsApp chats to legal documents?</strong></li></ol><p>To export WhatsApp chats to legal documents, you need to open WhatsApp on your device. Now locate the conversation you want to export and tap the three-dots option from the top right corner. From the ensuing menu options, select “More” and press “Export Chat.” You will be presented with options to include or exclude media in the export. Select the desired option to export the chat.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device without physical access?</strong></li></ol><p>No, tracking WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device requires physical access to that device. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted for all users. This means that they are only accessible on the Apple iPhone 14 device where the account was registered. To track someone’s WhatsApp messages, you would generally need to install monitoring software. Along with that, you should gain physical access to their device to set up monitoring tools.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages if they are backed up on iCloud?</strong></li></ol><p>WhatsApp provides users with the option to back up their chat history to iCloud. While these backups can help restore chats, they are not designed for real-time tracking purposes. To access the conversations in the backup files, you will need to use a tool or service with decryption capabilities. It is due to the fact that WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, tracking WhatsApp messages can be helpful in various scenarios.

As soon you entered the details, the monitoring process will get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100180578971.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-access the target device"                ></p><p>Step 3: After that, you will be allowed to open Control Panel.

That you can access from anywhere, such as your system, mobile, laptop, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100180804204.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-the mSpy Control Panel"                ></p><p>Following the above simple steps will enable you to track a Cell Phone without them Knowing.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-track-Android-or-iPhone-using-FlexiSPY"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-track-Android-or-iPhone-using-FlexiSPY" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to track Android or iPhone using FlexiSPY?"></a>Part 2: How to track Android or iPhone using FlexiSPY?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.flexispy.com/" >FlexiSPY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a commonly used tracking system for cell phones. It assures one of the best ways to track a cell phone without them knowing. But you need to jailbreak iPhone before installing FlexiSPY. For android devices, the root service is required for certain advanced features.</p><p>After installing the Flexispy on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device you want to monitor, all the relevant information you want to monitor (GPS location, calls, texts) will upload to its server without knowing. The only thing you need to do is log in to your Flexispy account and click “Location” if you would like to track a cell phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/track-cell-phone-with-flexispy-02.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-the flexispy"                ></p><p>Except for viewing the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device location data, you can also export GPS data to use on the mapping application you like.</p><p>How to Export GPS data:</p><p>Step 1: Click the “Export” button on the upper right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/track-cell-phone-with-flexispy-03.jpg"                      alt="export gps data"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click the “Download” button on the pop-up window that appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/track-cell-phone-with-flexispy-04.jpg"                      alt="download gps datay"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-secretly-track-someone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-secretly-track-someone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to secretly track someone"></a>Part 3: How to secretly track someone</h2><p>If you want to track a cell phone without them knowing secretly, then one interesting solution is the “Find my friends” app introduced by Apple though primarily not for spying purposes, but you can use it to spy on someone’s iPhone secretly. This app comes with the facility to get a notification when the target person arrives or leaves a place. Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p>Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone. To enable share my location, open the app “Find my friends” &gt; Go for the contact’s photo &gt; “Share my location”.</p><p>Step 2: Generally iCloud account has sharing options for all other devices. We have to ensure the sharing option is correctly viewed as the target device such as “This device”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100182891050.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-share my location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now swipe from bottom to end, click on the “Airdrop” option from the settings. You will have two options such as “Everyone” and “Contacts only”.</p><p>Step 4: Move to the target device, in the “Find my friends” app click the option “add”. Now your contact picture will get displayed. Click on your profile photo &gt; select the option “Share indefinitely” to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183209840.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-Share indefinitely"                ></p><p>Step 5: The target device location will be shared with you. You will get a pop-up window “Accept” it. It will again ask if you want to share location so, click on “Don’t share”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183459135.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-click Don’t share"                ></p><p>Step 6: Now go to your device, open the “Find my friends” app and click the icon of the target device. You will get a notification, where they are now when they leave from the place etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183691634.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-get a notification"                ></p><p>Note: If you want to hide the “Find my friends” app from the target device you can use the dock method which will be easy but the folder method is very tough.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183889994.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-hide the Find my friends app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p><strong>1. What is rooting? Does it have a warranty? Any rooting between Android and mSpy?</strong></p><p>Rooting is obviously known as the control between Android users and Android subsystems. It has a warranty period and rooting is applicable if you track WhatsApp, Facebook messages.</p><p><strong>2. How one can detect the software to monitor on an Android device?</strong></p><p>mSpy is authorized and certified software and it has to run legally on both user and the target device. If the illegal process is found, you can assist customer support immediately.</p><p><strong>3. If the phone was stolen, can I find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus using the number?</strong></p><p>mSpy activates if installed on the iPhone completely. The process of finding the phone using a number is not applicable in mSpy.</p><p>We must tell you using mSpy and FlexiSPY are both one of the best methods to track a cell phone. Both the applications have several metrics and would certainly assist in how to track a cell phone without them knowing. We know that tracking a cell phone without them knowing is illegal, but when it comes to our children’s safety we have to do this at any cost.</p><h2 id="Two-Ways-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-without-Him-Knowing"><a href="#Two-Ways-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-without-Him-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend’s Apple iPhone 14 Plus without Him Knowing"></a>Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend’s Apple iPhone 14 Plus without Him Knowing</h2><p>How can I track my boyfriend’s phone? If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?"></a>Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?</h2><p>When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy"                ></p><p>1. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.</p><p>2. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.</p><p>3. Go to its Settings &gt; Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600151360.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-download from Unknown Sources"                ></p><p>4. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.</p><p>5. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.</p><p>6. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600392625.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-access its web-based dashboard"                ></p><p>Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?"></a>Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?</h2><p>As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – <a class="link"   href="https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/" >KidsGuard Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Anyone who has web access can obtain information or connect to the rest of the world in two shakes. No need to turn the library upside down just to find what you’re looking for. All it takes is just a few taps on your electronic device to get things done. That’s the simplest explain of how the internet does magic to make our digital world a lot better.</p><p>However, we should never let our guard down whenever we go online and browse the web. We never know. There might be someone on the other side of the world who’s tracking our internet activities and collecting sensitive data. Is it possible to happen? The short answer is absolutely yes. As mentioned earlier, the power of the internet is relatively boundless. Anything, whether good or bad, can take place online in a blink of an eye. Hence, keep your digital footprints private with the aid of <strong>anti-tracker software.</strong></p><p>In this article, we will delve into the essential benefits of anti-tracker software when surfing the internet. We will also provide a list of the <strong>best anti-tracking software</strong> that you can try to use. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Everything-You-Should-Know-About-Anti-Tracker-Software"><a href="#Part-1-Everything-You-Should-Know-About-Anti-Tracker-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Anti-Tracker Software"></a>Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Anti-Tracker Software</h2><p>Just like any other thing in our digital world today, the internet has its good and bad sides. One minute, it can be a solution. The next, it can be a problem. That’s why you should keep everything in check whenever you surf the web. Make sure that you are browsing privately on your device and that no one is watching you somewhere. Is there a feasible way to protect yourself from this kind of cyber intrusion? Fortunately, there is. You can install anti-tracker software on your gadget and activate it whenever you use the internet. By far, it’s doing a great job in this regard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-1.JPG"                      alt="browsing the internet"                ></p><p>Anti-tracker software generally immobilizes suspicious websites or plugins on your browsing device and prevents them from stealing your data online. It’s quite different from Virtual Private Networks because VPNs only encrypt browsing traffic and IP address. But regardless, both of them can indeed help you maintain anonymity when surfing online. Just choose the best anti-tracking software that matches your needs and works perfectly with your situation.</p><p>One way or another, anti-tracker software can be of great help to you. Check out the list of benefits below to understand it very well. For sure, the information provided below can guide you towards the best anti-tracking software options.</p><h3 id="It-restricts-anyone-from-accessing-and-stealing-your-personal-information"><a href="#It-restricts-anyone-from-accessing-and-stealing-your-personal-information" class="headerlink" title="It restricts anyone from accessing and stealing your personal information"></a>It restricts anyone from accessing and stealing your personal information</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-2.JPG"                      alt="sensitive information"                ></p><p>In today’s digital era, where identity theft is rampant everywhere, privacy matters the most. Keeping our personal data away from public access is the least we can do to protect ourselves. That’s why you should consider installing anti-tracker software on your devices. Somehow, it can give you an assurance that the sensitive information you share online is not out in the open. But, of course, choose the best anti-tracking software that is powerful enough to do that for you.</p><h3 id="It-keeps-your-browsing-history-private"><a href="#It-keeps-your-browsing-history-private" class="headerlink" title="It keeps your browsing history private"></a>It keeps your browsing history private</h3><p>What happens if hackers get their hands on your browsing history? Well, there are lots of possibilities, and most of them can directly affect you. Information pertaining to the websites you visit on the internet is mostly used by third-party partners for research and advertising. Hackers sell it to them, along with other sensitive information embedded in your browser. Of course, nobody wants that. It’s clearly an invasion of privacy. Therefore, install anti-tracker software on your device to prevent this kind of situation from happening.</p><h3 id="It-prevents-advertisers-from-using-your-private-information"><a href="#It-prevents-advertisers-from-using-your-private-information" class="headerlink" title="It prevents advertisers from using your private information"></a>It prevents advertisers from using your private information</h3><p>It is nice if the ads that show up while we’re browsing include products we’re personally interested in. Hence, we cannot deny that giving legitimate advertisers access to our preferences is somehow beneficial to a certain degree. However, there are some third-party affiliates that are quite aggressive in tracking our browsing data. We should get rid of that the moment we spot them red-handed. It’s best to use anti-tracker software just to be sure.</p><h3 id="It-protects-us-from-internet-scams"><a href="#It-protects-us-from-internet-scams" class="headerlink" title="It protects us from internet scams"></a>It protects us from internet scams</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-3.JPG"                      alt="internet scam frauds"                ></p><p>Identity theft is one. But to tell you, internet fraud scams come in a variety of forms. Although each of them differs at some point, most of the attacks start from stolen information. That’s why you should do everything in your power to keep your data secure and private. Don’t let anyone get access to it as though your personal details are public materials. Start by being cautious when you share confidential information online. Before you give them out, make sure that the transaction and the website involved are legitimate.

Everything You Should Know About Anti-Tracker Software</h2><p>Just like any other thing in our digital world today, the internet has its good and bad sides. One minute, it can be a solution.

Keeping our personal data away from public access is the least we can do to protect ourselves. That’s why you should consider installing anti-tracker software on your devices. Somehow, it can give you an assurance that the sensitive information you share online is not out in the open. But, of course, choose the best anti-tracking software that is powerful enough to do that for you.</p><h3 id="It-keeps-your-browsing-history-private"><a href="#It-keeps-your-browsing-history-private" class="headerlink" title="It keeps your browsing history private"></a>It keeps your browsing history private</h3><p>What happens if hackers get their hands on your browsing history? Well, there are lots of possibilities, and most of them can directly affect you. Information pertaining to the websites you visit on the internet is mostly used by third-party partners for research and advertising. Hackers sell it to them, along with other sensitive information embedded in your browser. Of course, nobody wants that. It’s clearly an invasion of privacy. Therefore, install anti-tracker software on your device to prevent this kind of situation from happening.</p><h3 id="It-prevents-advertisers-from-using-your-private-information"><a href="#It-prevents-advertisers-from-using-your-private-information" class="headerlink" title="It prevents advertisers from using your private information"></a>It prevents advertisers from using your private information</h3><p>It is nice if the ads that show up while we’re browsing include products we’re personally interested in. Hence, we cannot deny that giving legitimate advertisers access to our preferences is somehow beneficial to a certain degree. However, there are some third-party affiliates that are quite aggressive in tracking our browsing data. We should get rid of that the moment we spot them red-handed. It’s best to use anti-tracker software just to be sure.</p><h3 id="It-protects-us-from-internet-scams"><a href="#It-protects-us-from-internet-scams" class="headerlink" title="It protects us from internet scams"></a>It protects us from internet scams</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-3.JPG"                      alt="internet scam frauds"                ></p><p>Identity theft is one. But to tell you, internet fraud scams come in a variety of forms. Although each of them differs at some point, most of the attacks start from stolen information. That’s why you should do everything in your power to keep your data secure and private. Don’t let anyone get access to it as though your personal details are public materials. Start by being cautious when you share confidential information online. Before you give them out, make sure that the transaction and the website involved are legitimate. Another thing, install anti-tracker software on your device and activate it whenever you go online.

It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps.

If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.</p><p>So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy.

Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg"                      alt="sign in to iCloud"                ></p><p>If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg"                      alt="skip the two factor authentication process"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg"                      alt="head to the quick access link"                ></p><p>Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181495657.jpg"                      alt="locate the Find iPhone icon"                ></p><p>Step 3.

For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services. That’s indeed beneficial to all of us, especially in today’s ever-changing world. But definitely, it’s not possible if Google doesn’t have adequate location information from the pool of its users. Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products? If so, you can start by giving Google access to the location data on your Android smartphone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Top 4 Techniques to Turn Off Google Location Tracking on Android"></a>Part 2. Top 4 Techniques to Turn Off Google Location Tracking on Android</h2><p>There’s no denying that Google uses location information to give us the best experience possible. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean there is no risk at all. We cannot rule out the possibility of data breaches and disclosure of location information that is supposed to be private. If you’re worried about this kind of situation, you can prevent it from happening in a snap of a finger. Check out the four methods below on how to turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-off-the-location-services-on-your-Android-mobile-device"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-off-the-location-services-on-your-Android-mobile-device" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn off the location services on your Android mobile device"></a>Method 1: Turn off the location services on your Android mobile device</h3><p>“How to stop Google from tracking me?” Well, it’s actually very easy. You just need to deactivate the location service on your Android mobile device. After that, Google and other GPS-based applications on your smartphone will immediately lose access to your location data. Do you want to try it now? Check out the tutorial below on how to turn off Google location tracking by deactivating the location services on your phone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unlock your Android mobile device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold the <strong>Status</strong> bar and then swipe it down to bring out the Apple iPhone 6 device Control.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find and click <strong>Location.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-4.jpg"                      alt="location services"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Lastly, click <strong>Close</strong> to confirm the changes.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Deactivate-the-Google-App’s-location-access-on-your-Android-mobile-device"><a href="#Method-2-Deactivate-the-Google-App’s-location-access-on-your-Android-mobile-device" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Deactivate the Google App’s location access on your Android mobile device"></a>Method 2: Deactivate the Google App’s location access on your Android mobile device</h3><p>Let’s say you don’t want to cut the entire location access across your smartphone because other apps might malfunction. That’s fine. There is a way to deactivate the Google app’s location permission while the other apps remain unaffected. Are you more inclined to implement this decentralized approach? Check out the tutorial provided below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your Android smartphone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click <strong>Apps.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-5.jpg"                      alt="app list"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find and click <strong>Google</strong> on the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-6.jpg"                      alt="google on app list"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click <strong>Permissions.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-7.jpg"                      alt="google app permissions"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Click <strong>Location.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-8.jpg"                      alt="location access for google"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Lastly, click <strong>Don’t Allow.</strong> Alternatively, you may instead select <strong>Allow Only While Using the App</strong> or <strong>Ask Every Time</strong> if you wish to grant Google conditional access to your location data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-9.jpg"                      alt="disallow location access on google"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Toggle-off-the-Timeline-feature-on-your-Google-Account"><a href="#Method-3-Toggle-off-the-Timeline-feature-on-your-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Toggle off the Timeline feature on your Google Account"></a>Method 3: Toggle off the Timeline feature on your Google Account</h3><p>Timeline is a special Google feature that keeps a record of your location check-ins and routes taken for future reference. You can review it on the Google Maps app in case you need to visit the same place again. On the other hand, you can easily toggle it off if you don’t want Google tracking down your specific whereabouts.

Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone 6 device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 6 device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 6 device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup"                ></p><p>Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 6 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.</p><p>Step 4: You can then log in to your <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 6 device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 6 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079748088200.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-log in to your mSpy control panel"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak"></a>Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak</h2><p>Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 6 device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 6 device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 6 device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 6 device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.</p><p>Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy"                ></p><p>Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 6 device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the</p><p>device will however make it easier for the Apple iPhone 6 device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.</p><h2 id="Top-7-Phone-Number-Locators-To-Track-Apple-iPhone-6-Location"><a href="#Top-7-Phone-Number-Locators-To-Track-Apple-iPhone-6-Location" class="headerlink" title="Top 7 Phone Number Locators To Track Apple iPhone 6 Location"></a>Top 7 Phone Number Locators To Track Apple iPhone 6 Location</h2><p>Don’t we all have those dreaded, unremitting phone calls from an unknown number?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Detect-and-Remove-Spyware-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus"><a href="#How-to-Detect-and-Remove-Spyware-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 7 Plus?"></a>How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 7 Plus?</h2><p>As scary as it sounds, it is actually quite possible that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus. These hackers and sometimes amateurs make use of sophisticated spy software to infiltrate your device and have access to your information. If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device and how to eliminate the threat. This article will help you with both.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?"></a>Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?</h2><p>The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.</p><p>It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?</h2><p>The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 7 Plus is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone 7 Plus is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone 7 Plus is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4. Background Noises"></a><strong>4. Background Noises</strong></h4><p>When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone 7 Plus in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.</p><h2 id="How-to-Track-WhatsApp-Messages-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Without-Them-Knowing"><a href="#How-to-Track-WhatsApp-Messages-on-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-Without-Them-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="How to Track WhatsApp Messages on Apple iPhone 7 Plus Without Them Knowing?"></a>How to Track WhatsApp Messages on Apple iPhone 7 Plus Without Them Knowing?</h2><p>Apps for messaging, such as WhatsApp, have transformed how people communicate. WhatsApp is the most popular and reliable messaging app worldwide, with over 2 billion active users. It is largely due to its extensive user base and advanced features. Moreover, it offers a convenient means to stay connected with friends and family. Nevertheless, concerns about privacy and security have also emerged among WhatsApp users.</p><p>WhatsApp promises that all messages are encrypted, giving users another great reason to use the service. But even a platform such as WhatsApp can be misused easily both by young and old and everyone in between. This is why it becomes important to install WhatsApp tracking software to know that it is used for good purposes. But the big question on your mind is <strong>how to track WhatsApp chats on another phone</strong>. We will discuss different techniques, including built-in features and WhatsApp trackers.</p><p><em><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Are you being tracked by others? You can <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-whatsapp.html" >fake your WhatsApp location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to avoid this.</em></p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-You-Track-Messages-on-WhatsApp"><a href="#Part-1-Can-You-Track-Messages-on-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can You Track Messages on WhatsApp?"></a>Part 1: Can You Track Messages on WhatsApp?</h2><p>Before going after <strong>how to spy on someone’s WhatsApp</strong>, it is essential to find out if it is possible in the first place. WhatsApp is renowned for its end-to-end encryption. It is a security feature that ensures messages remain private. Moreover, these messages are accessible only to the intended recipients. This encryption makes it extremely challenging to intercept or track WhatsApp messages.</p><p>That means it is unlikely that tracking could be done directly through the app’s servers. However, there are certain scenarios and methods through which WhatsApp messages can be tracked.

You can also see both sent and received messages.</p><p>Here’s how to use Auto Forward to spy on another iPhone’s text messages.</p><p>Step 1: To begin with, download and install Auto Forward onto your computer or another iOS device.</p><p>Step 2: Log in to your account (that you would have created before installing the app) and enter the Apple ID and password of the iPhone you want to spy on.</p><p>Step 3: The app will automatically access all messages on the target device. It will however only work if you have the target device’s Apple login details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074689453332.jpg"                      alt="Spy on text messages from another iPhone via Auto Forward"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-computer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Spy on text messages from computer"></a>Part 3: How to Spy on text messages from computer</h2><p>If you want to spy on someone else’s text messages on your computer, a monitoring program like <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be a good choice.
