But what if you don’ have the app installed? Does that mean that you have to bid adieu to your Apple iPhone 14 forever? Not really, because we are about to reveal to you 5 different ways to track your Apple iPhone 14 without app, so you can hopefully find your phone in the condition it went astray.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue"><a href="#Part-1-Solution-1-–-Apple’s-iCloud-to-the-rescue" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue"></a>Part 1: Solution 1 – Apple’s iCloud to the rescue</h2><p>Take note that this solution will not work if you haven’t activated the Find My iPhone service when you set up your device. If you have, here’s how to go about it.</p><p>Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg"                      alt="sign in to iCloud"                ></p><p>If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg"                      alt="skip the two factor authentication process"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg"                      alt="head to the quick access link"                ></p><p>Step 2. From the dashboard, locate the Find iPhone icon on the second row and click on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181495657.jpg"                      alt="locate the Find iPhone icon"                ></p><p>Step 3. Hover over to the All Devices dropdown menu and choose your Apple iPhone 14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075181861335.jpg"                      alt="choose your Apple iPhone 14"                ></p><p>Step 4. The tracking process will now begin, and you should be able to see it displayed on an interactive map if successful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075182429793.jpg"                      alt="begin to track the phone"                ></p><p>Step 5. Once you know the exact location of your device, you can do one of three things—activate lost mode, trigger an acoustic signal or erase all data.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Solution-2-Google-to-the-Rescue"><a href="#Part-2-Solution-2-Google-to-the-Rescue" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue"></a>Part 2: Solution 2 - Google to the Rescue</h2><p>Note that this solution will only work if you have Location Services enabled on your Apple iPhone 14.</p><p>It’s no surprise that both Apple and the search giant are fond of gathering information on all sorts of things, most notably your location. Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png"                      alt="head to the Google Timeline to track your Apple iPhone 14"                ></p><p>Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.</p><p>Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.</p><p>Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-Apple-iPhone-14"><a href="#Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-Apple-iPhone-14" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone 14"></a>Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone 14</h2><p>If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.</p><p>This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your Apple iPhone 14, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.</p><p>Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075191479909.jpg"                      alt="Use Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone 14"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing"><a href="#Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing"></a>Part 4: Solution 4. Have another iPhone? Use it to Track one that’s gone missing</h2><p>This method requires that you have Find My Friend enabled on both your missing iPhone and the one you’re going to use to track it. Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Apple iPhone 14 device.</p><p>Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.</p><p>Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.</p><p>Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your Apple iPhone 14 and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.</p><p>Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075192666907.jpg"                      alt="use another phone to track the missing one"                ></p><p>Step 4. When you’re ready to begin tracking, open up the Find My Friends app, click on their contact (your contact in this case) to see its exact location in real time.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Solution-5-Using-mSpy-to-track-an-iPhone"><a href="#Part-5-Solution-5-Using-mSpy-to-track-an-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Solution 5.

Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone 14 device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 14 device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 14 device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup"                ></p><p>Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 14 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.</p><p>Step 4: You can then log in to your <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 14 device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 14 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079748088200.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-log in to your mSpy control panel"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886019/19272" target="_top" id="1886019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886019/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak"></a>Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak</h2><p>Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 14 device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 14 device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 14 device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 14 device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.</p><p>Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy"                ></p><p>Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 14 device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the</p><p>device will however make it easier for the Apple iPhone 14 device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-gamers-guide-to-elite-streaming-platforms/"><u>[New] Gamers' Guide to Elite Streaming Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-guide-to-discovering-your-unique-tiktok-tag-for-2024/"><u>[New] Guide to Discovering Your Unique TikTok Tag for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-historical-gems-art-unshackled-by-laws/"><u>[New] Historical Gems Art Unshackled by Laws</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/n-2024-master-your-youtube-experience-with-premium-subscription/"><u>[New] In 2024, Master Your YouTube Experience with Premium Subscription</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-the-undisclosed-aspects-what-you-dont-notice-as-a-story-viewer/"><u>[New] The Undisclosed Aspects What You Don’t Notice as a Story Viewer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-six-innovative-approaches-for-recording-and-storing-mov-files-on-windows-11/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Six Innovative Approaches for Recording and Storing MOV Files on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-turbo-testing-our-compreenas-five-best-racing-games/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Turbo Testing Our Compreenas Five Best Racing Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-microsofts-hololens-adventure-a-3d-visionary-experience/"><u>[Updated] Microsoft’s HoloLens Adventure – A 3D Visionary Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-track-apple-iphone-14-plus-without-app-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 14 Plus without App | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-detect-and-remove-spyware-on-apple-iphone-15-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 15? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-intercept-text-messages-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone 11 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-i-stop-someone-from-tracking-my-apple-iphone-xr-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Apple iPhone XR? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-a-lost-apple-iphone-12-mini-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 12 mini for Free? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-location-by-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Track Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Location by Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/solutions-to-spy-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-with-and-without-jailbreak-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Solutions to Spy on Apple iPhone 13 Pro with and without jailbreak | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-composing-for-cinema-adding-musical-layers-to-video-content/"><u>Updated Composing for Cinema Adding Musical Layers to Video Content</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location - change your mobile device GPS to any place in the world with just 1 click <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number"><a href="#Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?"></a>Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?</h2><p>A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from whoever has the phone.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Detect-and-Remove-Spyware-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#How-to-Detect-and-Remove-Spyware-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max?"></a>How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max?</h2><p>As scary as it sounds, it is actually quite possible that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. These hackers and sometimes amateurs make use of sophisticated spy software to infiltrate your device and have access to your information. If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and how to eliminate the threat. This article will help you with both.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?"></a>Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?</h2><p>The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.</p><p>It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?</h2><p>The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4. Background Noises"></a><strong>4. Background Noises</strong></h4><p>When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.</p><h2 id="How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Location-by-Number"><a href="#How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Location-by-Number" class="headerlink" title="How to Track Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Location by Number"></a>How to Track Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Location by Number</h2><p>If you need to know where is your partner, you can quickly locate him&#x2F;her through a GPS facility on your cell phone.

Here are the answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding this topic from the internet:</p><ol><li><strong>How do I export WhatsApp chats to legal documents?</strong></li></ol><p>To export WhatsApp chats to legal documents, you need to open WhatsApp on your device. Now locate the conversation you want to export and tap the three-dots option from the top right corner. From the ensuing menu options, select “More” and press “Export Chat.” You will be presented with options to include or exclude media in the export. Select the desired option to export the chat.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device without physical access?</strong></li></ol><p>No, tracking WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device requires physical access to that device. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted for all users. This means that they are only accessible on the Apple iPhone 15 device where the account was registered. To track someone’s WhatsApp messages, you would generally need to install monitoring software. Along with that, you should gain physical access to their device to set up monitoring tools.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages if they are backed up on iCloud?</strong></li></ol><p>WhatsApp provides users with the option to back up their chat history to iCloud. While these backups can help restore chats, they are not designed for real-time tracking purposes. To access the conversations in the backup files, you will need to use a tool or service with decryption capabilities. It is due to the fact that WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, tracking WhatsApp messages can be helpful in various scenarios.

Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services. That’s indeed beneficial to all of us, especially in today’s ever-changing world. But definitely, it’s not possible if Google doesn’t have adequate location information from the pool of its users. Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products? If so, you can start by giving Google access to the location data on your Android smartphone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

And for that, there is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an app that allows you to not only track Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro location but rings in with several other handy features.</p><p>Billed as the ultimate software for parental control, <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows PC and MAC OS and is easily accessible from any web browser. It is easy to install and if you experience any hiccups, you can always refer to the free online help. Further, it is available in several countries and backed by stellar multi-language customer support. mSpy offers three unique plans to choose from, each with its rich set of features that include the ability to manage calls, track text messages, read emails, track GPS location, monitor browsing history and internet use, control apps and programs and read instant messages from the app such as WhatsApp for a grand total of 24 features.</p><p>Step 1. After selecting the right plan for your needs, you will have to register the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100202731.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-register the software"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, you will have to set up the app with information on your target device and that’s it! You can now access the mSpy dashboard and begin tracking your cell phone location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100515661.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-setup the app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1061528/11832" target="_top" id="1061528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1061528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1061528/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3. You can select from several options in the left hand, two of the most noteworthy being geo-fencing and WhatsApp. Geo-fencing is a great feature to monitor both your kids and employees and basically, allows you to set up parameters and alert you when they are breached.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100786594.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-select from several options"                ></p><p>WhatsApp is a highly secure chat application, but mSpy backed by the latest technology also allows you to monitor its messages both incoming and outgoing. Simply click on the WhatsApp tab and you will be presented with a list of WhatsApp messages that you can further sort through by date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082101238393.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-sort through WhatsApp messages by date"                ></p><p>There are several instances such as in the excitement of getting a new phone that we may overlook the need to install software to track a cell phone. But both Google and Apple are generous enough to offer a solution to track your cell phone location without having to install any third-party software. But if you’re like to do a lot more than just track your cell phone’s location, mSpy with its expensive list of features sets the gold standard in this space.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-deciding-on-live-stream-software-streamlabs-vs-obs-comparison/"><u>[Updated] Deciding on Live Stream Software Streamlabs Vs.

This app comes with the facility to get a notification when the target person arrives or leaves a place. Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p>Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone. To enable share my location, open the app “Find my friends” &gt; Go for the contact’s photo &gt; “Share my location”.</p><p>Step 2: Generally iCloud account has sharing options for all other devices. We have to ensure the sharing option is correctly viewed as the target device such as “This device”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100182891050.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-share my location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now swipe from bottom to end, click on the “Airdrop” option from the settings. You will have two options such as “Everyone” and “Contacts only”.</p><p>Step 4: Move to the target device, in the “Find my friends” app click the option “add”. Now your contact picture will get displayed. Click on your profile photo &gt; select the option “Share indefinitely” to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183209840.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-Share indefinitely"                ></p><p>Step 5: The target device location will be shared with you.

What is rooting? Does it have a warranty? Any rooting between Android and mSpy?</strong></p><p>Rooting is obviously known as the control between Android users and Android subsystems. It has a warranty period and rooting is applicable if you track WhatsApp, Facebook messages.</p><p><strong>2. How one can detect the software to monitor on an Android device?</strong></p><p>mSpy is authorized and certified software and it has to run legally on both user and the target device. If the illegal process is found, you can assist customer support immediately.</p><p><strong>3. If the phone was stolen, can I find My Apple iPhone 15 using the number?</strong></p><p>mSpy activates if installed on the iPhone completely. The process of finding the phone using a number is not applicable in mSpy.</p><p>We must tell you using mSpy and FlexiSPY are both one of the best methods to track a cell phone. Both the applications have several metrics and would certainly assist in how to track a cell phone without them knowing. We know that tracking a cell phone without them knowing is illegal, but when it comes to our children’s safety we have to do this at any cost.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-obs-audio-fix-strategies-quickly/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, OBS Audio Fix Strategies Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-the-art-of-tiktok-visual-enhancements/"><u>[Updated] Mastering the Art of TikTok Visual Enhancements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-declutter-your-visuals-learn-background-removal-with-photopea/"><u>2024 Approved Declutter Your Visuals Learn Background Removal with Photopea</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/can-life360-track-or-see-text-messages-what-can-you-do-with-life360-on-oneplus-ace-2v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Can Life360 Track Or See Text Messages?

Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup"                ></p><p>Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.</p><p>Step 4: You can then log in to your <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079748088200.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-log in to your mSpy control panel"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak"></a>Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak</h2><p>Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.</p><p>Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy"                ></p><p>Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the</p><p>device will however make it easier for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.</p><h2 id="How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Location-by-Number"><a href="#How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Location-by-Number" class="headerlink" title="How to Track Apple iPhone 15 Pro Location by Number"></a>How to Track Apple iPhone 15 Pro Location by Number</h2><p>If you need to know where is your partner, you can quickly locate him&#x2F;her through a GPS facility on your cell phone.

This app has three buttons on the main screen: find parking, save (to know where you parked) and look for the car. Thanks to this option, you have a map and a compass that will help guide you to get to the car. In addition, you can share the location of our car via Facebook, Twitter or SMS.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Vehicle locator connected to your iOS or Android device.</p><p>Can check available parking in your area.</p><p>It is free.</p><p>Can check the parking prices also in real time.</p><p>Has database for more than 500 cities in America, Europe, and more countries.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081722994485.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Parkme"                ></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/parkme-parking/id417605484?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/parkme-parking/id417605484?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parkme.consumer&amp;hl=es" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parkme.consumer&amp;hl=es <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-3-Automatic"><a href="#Option-3-Automatic" class="headerlink" title="Option 3: Automatic"></a>Option 3: Automatic</h2><p>Introduction: This is a car locator device system that helps us find where we parked our car. It works by connecting our car with the mobile phone and allowing us to know at all times the location of our car, something very useful in case of missing or even theft. In addition, in case of an accident, we can notify the emergency services through the same application.</p><p>This app to find your car consists of a sensor connected to the mobile application and all we have to do is install it in the OBD (On Board Diagnostics) port of our vehicle, usually located next to the instrument control or around of the center console. It is available for iOS. Apart from looking for the car, this app allows us to control through Bluetooth also the consumption of gasoline, the effort that has made the engine, if you suffer and how to avoid it while advising us on how to achieve and maintain optimal driving.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Can receive free emergency help in case of a crash.</p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Available in English.</p><p>Compatible with iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch</p><p>Control if you need gasoline through Bluetooth</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723208344.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Automatic"                ></p><p>URL:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137222/26400" target="_top" id="2137222">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137222" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137222/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version"><a href="#Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)"></a>Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)</h2><p>Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.</p><p>Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones.

Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from whoever has the phone.

Open the main Google search page and type in “find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus”, and you should be presented with results showing your cell phone’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082098089360.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone-type in"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Track-a-Cell-Phone-Location-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Track-a-Cell-Phone-Location-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Track a Cell Phone Location via mSpy?"></a>Part 3: How to Track a Cell Phone Location via mSpy?</h2><p>We’ve just given you two solutions to how to track a cell phone location without installing software, but they are limited in the features they offer, meaning you can just check cell phone location. But there may be times when you may feel the need to get a comprehensive look or rather a mirror image of what your cell phone is being used for. And for that, there is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an app that allows you to not only track Your Apple iPhone 14 Plus location but rings in with several other handy features.</p><p>Billed as the ultimate software for parental control, <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows PC and MAC OS and is easily accessible from any web browser. It is easy to install and if you experience any hiccups, you can always refer to the free online help. Further, it is available in several countries and backed by stellar multi-language customer support. mSpy offers three unique plans to choose from, each with its rich set of features that include the ability to manage calls, track text messages, read emails, track GPS location, monitor browsing history and internet use, control apps and programs and read instant messages from the app such as WhatsApp for a grand total of 24 features.</p><p>Step 1. After selecting the right plan for your needs, you will have to register the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100202731.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-register the software"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, you will have to set up the app with information on your target device and that’s it! You can now access the mSpy dashboard and begin tracking your cell phone location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100515661.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-setup the app"                ></p><p>Step 3. You can select from several options in the left hand, two of the most noteworthy being geo-fencing and WhatsApp. Geo-fencing is a great feature to monitor both your kids and employees and basically, allows you to set up parameters and alert you when they are breached.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100786594.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-select from several options"                ></p><p>WhatsApp is a highly secure chat application, but mSpy backed by the latest technology also allows you to monitor its messages both incoming and outgoing. Simply click on the WhatsApp tab and you will be presented with a list of WhatsApp messages that you can further sort through by date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082101238393.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-sort through WhatsApp messages by date"                ></p><p>There are several instances such as in the excitement of getting a new phone that we may overlook the need to install software to track a cell phone. But both Google and Apple are generous enough to offer a solution to track your cell phone location without having to install any third-party software. But if you’re like to do a lot more than just track your cell phone’s location, mSpy with its expensive list of features sets the gold standard in this space.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-best-practices-in-youtube-keyword-selection-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best Practices in YouTube Keyword Selection for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-enhance-engagement-with-these-4-looping-video-techniques/"><u>[New] In 2024, Enhance Engagement with These 4 Looping Video Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-integrated-mac-system-screenmicrophone-recording/"><u>[New] In 2024, Integrated Mac System Screen/Microphone Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-premium-8-editors-compatible-with-linux/"><u>[Updated] Premium 8 Editors Compatible with Linux</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-wisdom-waves-prime-ed-channels-online/"><u>2024 Approved Wisdom Waves Prime Ed Channels Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/bypassing-mac-protection-access-untrusted-application-errors/"><u>Bypassing Mac Protection – Access 'Untrusted' Application Errors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-apple-iphone-14-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Apple iPhone 14 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-detect-and-remove-spyware-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 12 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-reset-itunes-backup-password-of-iphone-se-2020-prevention-and-solution-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Reset iTunes Backup Password Of iPhone SE (2020) Prevention & Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-iphone-light-balancing/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to iPhone Light Balancing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-tracking-apps-to-track-apple-iphone-se-2022-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 5 Tracking Apps to Track Apple iPhone SE (2022) without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/revive-stuck-chatgpt-iphone-solutions-you-can-implement-today/"><u>Revive Stuck ChatGPT: IPhone Solutions You Can Implement Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/top-5-car-locator-apps-for-apple-iphone-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Top 5 Car Locator Apps for Apple iPhone 8 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-14-for-Free"><a href="#How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-14-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 14 for Free?"></a>How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 14 for Free?</h2><p>A cell phone is a rather small device when compared to other things you may haul around on a daily basis such as a purse or wallet and even a bunch of keys. Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely. However, with the increase in modern mobile technology, there are several apps that can help you track your lost cell phone’s whereabouts. But you’ve already paid a premium price for your cell phone, so what you really should do is learn how to track a lost phone for free?</p><p>And if you haven’t done so already, you should also install apps whether paid or free that do more than GPS location tracking such as monitoring incoming and outgoing calls, text and multimedia messages. So if you’re wondering how to track your lost phone for free, we’ve got a few solutions that will help you do just that, and others that bring to the table a wide range of great features.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?"></a>Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?</h2><p>One of the noteworthy features of iPhones is that they tend to retain great value for many years to come hence they become a preferred choice for prying thieves. Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your Apple iPhone 14 can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.</p><p>But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Apple iPhone 14 device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Apple iPhone 14 device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.</p><p>Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your Apple iPhone 14, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080421681564.jpeg"                      alt="track your lost phone for free with iCloud"                ></p><p>Step 2. Now it’s time to hit the cloud—iCloud we mean! First things first—head to &lt;<a href="http://www.iCloud.com>">www.iCloud.com&gt;</a> from any browser and login with your credentials. From the dashboard, click on Find iPhone in the second row and enter your Apple ID and password if prompted. Since you may have several Apple devices connected with the same iCloud account, click on All Devices at the top, and select the Apple iPhone 14 device you wish to track from the dropdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422049397.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for free-click on Find iPhone and All Devices"                ></p><p>Step 3. That’s really all there is to it! Once you select your device, you can do one of three things—play sound, activate lost mode or erase the Apple iPhone 14 device to prevent compromise of information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422409247.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for frees-start to track"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?</h2><p>If you’ve misplaced your Android cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Apple iPhone 14 device), and locations services on the Apple iPhone 14 device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with. Here’s how to track your lost phone with Google’s ADM.</p><p>Step 1. Most latest Android phones are already equipped with the Find My Service, but if you’re missing it, you can download it from the Google Play Store. Click start, tap security, and then device administration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422869617.jpeg"                      alt="Track Lost Android Mobile Location with Google’s ADM-install Find My Service"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, tap Find My Device, and check the box besides it. Tap the back button once and then again to return to the main settings menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080423235837.jpeg"                      alt="Track Lost Android Mobile Location-return to the main settings menu"                ></p><p>Step 3. To turn location services on, tap locations in the settings menu, tap mode so its turns green and then select high accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080423753576.jpeg"                      alt="Track with Google’s ADM-turn location services on"                ></p><p>Step 4. From the same window, tap Location History and turn it on and subsequently tap the button beside your device name to activate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080424126895.jpeg"                      alt="Track with Google’s ADM-activate the Apple iPhone 14 device"                ></p><p>Step 4. When you need to locate your device, type find my device in a web browser and select what usually is the first link. Enter your email and password associated with your device account, and you will be presented with a dashboard, from where you can send an audible tone to your device even if it were on silent, lock your phone or erase it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080424492002.jpeg"                      alt="Track with Google’s ADM-locate your device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Track-Mobile-Phone-via-Spyera"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Track-Mobile-Phone-via-Spyera" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Track Mobile Phone via Spyera?"></a>Part 3: How to Track Mobile Phone via Spyera?</h2><p>Sometimes however, you will want to do a lot more than track a device such as knowing if your employees are misusing your business cellular plan or your kids are sending and receiving obscene multimedia messages from different chat applications including WhatsApp. So if you’re wondering how to track a lost phone and also access these premium features, two names immediately come to mind—Spyera and mSpy.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://spyera.com/" >Spyera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an award winning software and is compatible with both Android and iOS devices.

In this guide, I will let you know how to use Google location distance and radius features in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-1.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps"></a>Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps</h2><p>You might already know that Google Maps provides a map of the entire world for us to navigate. Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.</p><ol><li>Firstly, just go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php" >Map Developers circle tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any supported browser like Google Chrome.

For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.</p><ul><li><em>Map Developers Radius</em></li></ul><p>Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above. In this, you can just enter the name of a specific place on Google Maps. Now, you can specify the distance of radius in miles or kilometers. This will automatically draw the specific distance radius on Google Maps for the designated location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-4.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 4"                ></p><ul><li><em>KML Circle Generator</em></li></ul><p>If you know the exact longitude and latitude of the place, then you can also take the assistance of KML Circle Generator.

Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-6.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 6"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ol><li>Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu.

And for that, there is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an app that allows you to not only track Your Apple iPhone 14 location but rings in with several other handy features.</p><p>Billed as the ultimate software for parental control, <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows PC and MAC OS and is easily accessible from any web browser. It is easy to install and if you experience any hiccups, you can always refer to the free online help. Further, it is available in several countries and backed by stellar multi-language customer support. mSpy offers three unique plans to choose from, each with its rich set of features that include the ability to manage calls, track text messages, read emails, track GPS location, monitor browsing history and internet use, control apps and programs and read instant messages from the app such as WhatsApp for a grand total of 24 features.</p><p>Step 1. After selecting the right plan for your needs, you will have to register the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100202731.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-register the software"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, you will have to set up the app with information on your target device and that’s it! You can now access the mSpy dashboard and begin tracking your cell phone location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100515661.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-setup the app"                ></p><p>Step 3. You can select from several options in the left hand, two of the most noteworthy being geo-fencing and WhatsApp. Geo-fencing is a great feature to monitor both your kids and employees and basically, allows you to set up parameters and alert you when they are breached.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100786594.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-select from several options"                ></p><p>WhatsApp is a highly secure chat application, but mSpy backed by the latest technology also allows you to monitor its messages both incoming and outgoing. Simply click on the WhatsApp tab and you will be presented with a list of WhatsApp messages that you can further sort through by date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082101238393.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-sort through WhatsApp messages by date"                ></p><p>There are several instances such as in the excitement of getting a new phone that we may overlook the need to install software to track a cell phone. But both Google and Apple are generous enough to offer a solution to track your cell phone location without having to install any third-party software. But if you’re like to do a lot more than just track your cell phone’s location, mSpy with its expensive list of features sets the gold standard in this space.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-screen-casting-on-your-phone/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Screen Casting on Your Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/tribe-50-branding-banners-ready-to-unleash-in-2024/"><u>Free Tribe 50 Branding Banners Ready to Unleash, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-advanced-techniques-for-preserving-lol-skirmishes/"><u>In 2024, Advanced Techniques for Preserving LOL Skirmishes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-i-get-more-stardust-in-pokemon-go-on-realme-c53-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How can I get more stardust in pokemon go On Realme C53? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-intercept-text-messages-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-turn-off-google-location-to-stop-tracking-you-on-apple-iphone-se-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Apple iPhone SE | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/quotes-for-a-new-dimension-a-metaverse-visionary-collection-for-2024/"><u>Quotes for a New Dimension A Metaverse Visionary Collection for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/top-12-excelentes-software-de-conversion-4k-sin-coste-para-computadora-y-mac-transformar-contenido-desde-y-hacia-resolucion-full-hd/"><u>Top 12 Excelentes Software De Conversión 4K Sin Coste Para Computadora Y Mac - Transformar Contenido Desde Y Hacia Resolución Full HD</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/ways-to-stop-parent-tracking-your-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Ways to stop parent tracking your Apple iPhone 6 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services. That’s indeed beneficial to all of us, especially in today’s ever-changing world. But definitely, it’s not possible if Google doesn’t have adequate location information from the pool of its users. Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products? If so, you can start by giving Google access to the location data on your Android smartphone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918679/19272" target="_top" id="1918679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918679/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Top 4 Techniques to Turn Off Google Location Tracking on Android</h2><p>There’s no denying that Google uses location information to give us the best experience possible.

Apart from navigation, Google Maps can be used for different other applications as well. For instance, you can easily measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also use the Google Maps distance radius feature to focus on a certain area. In this guide, I will let you know how to use Google location distance and radius features in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-1.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps"></a>Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps</h2><p>You might already know that Google Maps provides a map of the entire world for us to navigate. Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.</p><ol><li>Firstly, just go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php" >Map Developers circle tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any supported browser like Google Chrome.

After entering all the needed details, click on the “New Circle” button and it will be reflected on Google Maps interface.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-3.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 3"                ></p><p>If you want, you can later delete this circle or draw multiple circles in different colors to mark them in any location of your choice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps"></a>Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps</h2><p>Apart from drawing a circle or radius on Google Maps, a lot of people would like to specify its distance as well. For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.</p><ul><li><em>Map Developers Radius</em></li></ul><p>Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above. In this, you can just enter the name of a specific place on Google Maps. Now, you can specify the distance of radius in miles or kilometers. This will automatically draw the specific distance radius on Google Maps for the designated location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-4.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 4"                ></p><ul><li><em>KML Circle Generator</em></li></ul><p>If you know the exact longitude and latitude of the place, then you can also take the assistance of KML Circle Generator. In this, you would have to specify the exact coordinates of the place and the Google Maps distance radius value. After entering the relevant details, you can proceed and draw the radius distance on Google Maps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-5.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 5"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Determine-the-Distance-between-two-Addresses-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-3-Determine-the-Distance-between-two-Addresses-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps"></a>Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps</h2><p>This is one of the most resourceful features of Google Maps that a lot of people are not aware of. Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-6.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 6"                ></p><ol><li>Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu. From the available options on the context menu, click on “Measure Distance”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-7.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 7"                ></p><ol><li>Afterward, just click anywhere else on the map and it will automatically find a straight line distance in Google Maps between these two spots.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-8.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 8"                ></p><ol><li>If you want to continue, then just click anywhere else on the map and that will be considered as the next spot. Therefore, you can just click as many times as you want to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-9.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 9"                ></p><p>This technique will let you measure distance between any addresses on Google Maps. It doesn’t matter if it is your present location or not. If you want to measure distance in some other location, then just enter its name in the search bar to load it. In this way, you can measure distance anywhere in the world by sitting in your home.</p><p>This brings us to the end of this extensive guide on using Google Maps distance and radius features. As you can see, I have provided a smart and user-friendly solution to draw radius distance on Google Maps.

However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location - change your mobile device GPS to any place in the world with just 1 click <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number"><a href="#Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?"></a>Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?</h2><p>A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 15 Pro via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 15 Pro in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 15 Pro from whoever has the phone. In this case, the application of <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be highly recommended.

For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services. That’s indeed beneficial to all of us, especially in today’s ever-changing world. But definitely, it’s not possible if Google doesn’t have adequate location information from the pool of its users. Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products? If so, you can start by giving Google access to the location data on your Android smartphone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Top 4 Techniques to Turn Off Google Location Tracking on Android</h2><p>There’s no denying that Google uses location information to give us the best experience possible. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean there is no risk at all. We cannot rule out the possibility of data breaches and disclosure of location information that is supposed to be private. If you’re worried about this kind of situation, you can prevent it from happening in a snap of a finger.

Apart from navigation, Google Maps can be used for different other applications as well. For instance, you can easily measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also use the Google Maps distance radius feature to focus on a certain area. In this guide, I will let you know how to use Google location distance and radius features in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-1.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps"></a>Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps</h2><p>You might already know that Google Maps provides a map of the entire world for us to navigate. Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.</p><ol><li>Firstly, just go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php" >Map Developers circle tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any supported browser like Google Chrome.

You can also enter the name of the location that you are looking for in the search bar.</li><li>Besides that, you can also enter details about the radius of the circle, its color, and so on. After entering all the needed details, click on the “New Circle” button and it will be reflected on Google Maps interface.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-3.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 3"                ></p><p>If you want, you can later delete this circle or draw multiple circles in different colors to mark them in any location of your choice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps"></a>Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps</h2><p>Apart from drawing a circle or radius on Google Maps, a lot of people would like to specify its distance as well. For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.</p><ul><li><em>Map Developers Radius</em></li></ul><p>Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above. In this, you can just enter the name of a specific place on Google Maps. Now, you can specify the distance of radius in miles or kilometers. This will automatically draw the specific distance radius on Google Maps for the designated location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-4.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 4"                ></p><ul><li><em>KML Circle Generator</em></li></ul><p>If you know the exact longitude and latitude of the place, then you can also take the assistance of KML Circle Generator. In this, you would have to specify the exact coordinates of the place and the Google Maps distance radius value. After entering the relevant details, you can proceed and draw the radius distance on Google Maps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-5.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 5"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Determine-the-Distance-between-two-Addresses-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-3-Determine-the-Distance-between-two-Addresses-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps"></a>Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps</h2><p>This is one of the most resourceful features of Google Maps that a lot of people are not aware of. Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-6.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 6"                ></p><ol><li>Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu. From the available options on the context menu, click on “Measure Distance”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-7.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 7"                ></p><ol><li>Afterward, just click anywhere else on the map and it will automatically find a straight line distance in Google Maps between these two spots.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-8.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 8"                ></p><ol><li>If you want to continue, then just click anywhere else on the map and that will be considered as the next spot. Therefore, you can just click as many times as you want to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-9.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 9"                ></p><p>This technique will let you measure distance between any addresses on Google Maps. It doesn’t matter if it is your present location or not. If you want to measure distance in some other location, then just enter its name in the search bar to load it. In this way, you can measure distance anywhere in the world by sitting in your home.</p><p>This brings us to the end of this extensive guide on using Google Maps distance and radius features. As you can see, I have provided a smart and user-friendly solution to draw radius distance on Google Maps.

For instance, text messages which are one of the most important components of every phone, can now be easily intercepted or spied on, courtesy some smart applications. Yes, it is a matter of minutes now to be able to spy on or intercept text messages even when not having the target device in your possession. Moreover, there are applications that work on all platforms whether it is android or iOS. But how do you intercept text messages? Well, if this is what’s playing in your mind; you are absolutely at the right place. In this article, we are going to discuss ways to intercept text messages from both iOS and Android Phones and how to know whether your text messages have been intercepted.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended android&#x2F;ios location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Virtual Location - the most trustworthy way to fake GPS on iPhone &#x2F;Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="fake GPS of mobile device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?"></a>Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?</h2><p>Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data. This feature helps when the phone is stolen. Installing mSpy on the target phone is extremely simple and involves very few steps. So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.</p><p><strong>Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones</strong></p><p>To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2.

Once the application is set up, it is going to work invisibly and the target user will never get to know that he is being monitored. The target phone will work normally and mSpy will not interfere in any of the applications installed on the target phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781234928456.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install the application"                ></p><p>Installing in Android</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781239566126.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing in Android"                ></p><p>Installing on iOS</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781241065208.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing on iOS"                ></p><p><strong>3. Start monitoring</strong></p><p>You can now start intercepting the text messages remotely from other phones. Use your account through your login credentials and get reports from the target phone pertaining to text message history, chats, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781244325874.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Start monitoring"                ></p><p>The above screen is the monitoring console through which we can see all the text messages on the target device.

While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up. This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.</p><p>2. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.</p><p>So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-for-Free"><a href="#How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 15 Plus for Free?"></a>How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 15 Plus for Free?</h2><p>A cell phone is a rather small device when compared to other things you may haul around on a daily basis such as a purse or wallet and even a bunch of keys. Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely. However, with the increase in modern mobile technology, there are several apps that can help you track your lost cell phone’s whereabouts. But you’ve already paid a premium price for your cell phone, so what you really should do is learn how to track a lost phone for free?</p><p>And if you haven’t done so already, you should also install apps whether paid or free that do more than GPS location tracking such as monitoring incoming and outgoing calls, text and multimedia messages. So if you’re wondering how to track your lost phone for free, we’ve got a few solutions that will help you do just that, and others that bring to the table a wide range of great features.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?"></a>Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?</h2><p>One of the noteworthy features of iPhones is that they tend to retain great value for many years to come hence they become a preferred choice for prying thieves. Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your Apple iPhone 15 Plus can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.</p><p>But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.</p><p>Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080421681564.jpeg"                      alt="track your lost phone for free with iCloud"                ></p><p>Step 2. Now it’s time to hit the cloud—iCloud we mean! First things first—head to &lt;<a href="http://www.iCloud.com>">www.iCloud.com&gt;</a> from any browser and login with your credentials. From the dashboard, click on Find iPhone in the second row and enter your Apple ID and password if prompted. Since you may have several Apple devices connected with the same iCloud account, click on All Devices at the top, and select the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you wish to track from the dropdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422049397.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for free-click on Find iPhone and All Devices"                ></p><p>Step 3. That’s really all there is to it! Once you select your device, you can do one of three things—play sound, activate lost mode or erase the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to prevent compromise of information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422409247.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for frees-start to track"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?</h2><p>If you’ve misplaced your Android cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device), and locations services on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with. Here’s how to track your lost phone with Google’s ADM.</p><p>Step 1. Most latest Android phones are already equipped with the Find My Service, but if you’re missing it, you can download it from the Google Play Store. Click start, tap security, and then device administration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422869617.jpeg"                      alt="Track Lost Android Mobile Location with Google’s ADM-install Find My Service"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, tap Find My Device, and check the box besides it. Tap the back button once and then again to return to the main settings menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080423235837.jpeg"                      alt="Track Lost Android Mobile Location-return to the main settings menu"                ></p><p>Step 3. To turn location services on, tap locations in the settings menu, tap mode so its turns green and then select high accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080423753576.jpeg"                      alt="Track with Google’s ADM-turn location services on"                ></p><p>Step 4. From the same window, tap Location History and turn it on and subsequently tap the button beside your device name to activate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080424126895.jpeg"                      alt="Track with Google’s ADM-activate the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device"                ></p><p>Step 4. When you need to locate your device, type find my device in a web browser and select what usually is the first link. Enter your email and password associated with your device account, and you will be presented with a dashboard, from where you can send an audible tone to your device even if it were on silent, lock your phone or erase it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080424492002.jpeg"                      alt="Track with Google’s ADM-locate your device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Track-Mobile-Phone-via-Spyera"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Track-Mobile-Phone-via-Spyera" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Track Mobile Phone via Spyera?"></a>Part 3: How to Track Mobile Phone via Spyera?</h2><p>Sometimes however, you will want to do a lot more than track a device such as knowing if your employees are misusing your business cellular plan or your kids are sending and receiving obscene multimedia messages from different chat applications including WhatsApp. So if you’re wondering how to track a lost phone and also access these premium features, two names immediately come to mind—Spyera and mSpy.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://spyera.com/" >Spyera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an award winning software and is compatible with both Android and iOS devices.

Here are the answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding this topic from the internet:</p><ol><li><strong>How do I export WhatsApp chats to legal documents?</strong></li></ol><p>To export WhatsApp chats to legal documents, you need to open WhatsApp on your device. Now locate the conversation you want to export and tap the three-dots option from the top right corner. From the ensuing menu options, select “More” and press “Export Chat.” You will be presented with options to include or exclude media in the export. Select the desired option to export the chat.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device without physical access?</strong></li></ol><p>No, tracking WhatsApp messages on someone else’s device requires physical access to that device. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted for all users. This means that they are only accessible on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device where the account was registered. To track someone’s WhatsApp messages, you would generally need to install monitoring software. Along with that, you should gain physical access to their device to set up monitoring tools.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Can I track WhatsApp messages if they are backed up on iCloud?</strong></li></ol><p>WhatsApp provides users with the option to back up their chat history to iCloud. While these backups can help restore chats, they are not designed for real-time tracking purposes. To access the conversations in the backup files, you will need to use a tool or service with decryption capabilities. It is due to the fact that WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, tracking WhatsApp messages can be helpful in various scenarios. These scenarios range from monitoring your conversations to ensuring the safety of loved ones. Throughout this article, we have explored different methods on <strong>how to track WhatsApp messages</strong>.

It works by connecting our car with the mobile phone and allowing us to know at all times the location of our car, something very useful in case of missing or even theft. In addition, in case of an accident, we can notify the emergency services through the same application.</p><p>This app to find your car consists of a sensor connected to the mobile application and all we have to do is install it in the OBD (On Board Diagnostics) port of our vehicle, usually located next to the instrument control or around of the center console. It is available for iOS. Apart from looking for the car, this app allows us to control through Bluetooth also the consumption of gasoline, the effort that has made the engine, if you suffer and how to avoid it while advising us on how to achieve and maintain optimal driving.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Can receive free emergency help in case of a crash.</p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Available in English.</p><p>Compatible with iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch</p><p>Control if you need gasoline through Bluetooth</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723208344.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Automatic"                ></p><p>URL:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version"><a href="#Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)"></a>Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)</h2><p>Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.</p><p>Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Shows available parking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723711372.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Google Maps"                ></p><p>URL is not available yet.</p><h2 id="Option-5-Waze"><a href="#Option-5-Waze" class="headerlink" title="Option 5: Waze"></a>Option 5: Waze</h2><p>Introduction: This app, compatible with Android and iOS is intended for users who go by car.</p><p>It allows to obtain routes and check movements in real time, besides visualizing possible obstacles in your way.</p><p>The application goes beyond navigation because it permits drivers to share road reports on accidents, police checks or any other danger along their way and get information about what is coming also. It uses satellite technology, so it does not require internet. This application helps you to find parking areas when you need one and can be activated as a GPS locator for the car.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>It is a car locator</p><p>Thanks to GPS you can find available parking</p><p>Get information in real-time if there is any problem in the way.</p><p>It is free and very easy to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081724223630.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Waze"                ></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>So, now onwards, you do not need to pay to get a GPS locator for the car, as you can see, there are many available options that you can use and choose to locate your car for free for both iOS and Android devices.

Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2.

Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3.

This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone 15 Pro in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.</p><h2 id="5-Ways-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-without-App"><a href="#5-Ways-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-without-App" class="headerlink" title="5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 15 Pro without App"></a>5 Ways to Track Apple iPhone 15 Pro without App</h2><p>The Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro app is a great addition to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, and as the name suggests helps you to not only track your phone in the event it is stolen, but also lock it so that it cannot be misused.

If you have, here’s how to go about it.</p><p>Step 1. Get started by heading over to iCloud, and logging in with your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/article/2017/10/icloud.com-login.jpg"                      alt="sign in to iCloud"                ></p><p>If you are greeted with the two factor authentication process, which asks you to insert a code that was sent to your devices, you can simply skip it by heading to the quick access link at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180348414.jpg"                      alt="skip the two factor authentication process"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075180363658.jpg"                      alt="head to the quick access link"                ></p><p>Step 2.

Google stores this information on its Timeline, so without ado, head to the Google Timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/example-trip-google-timeline.png"                      alt="head to the Google Timeline to track your Apple iPhone 15 Pro"                ></p><p>Step 2. Select the present date from the left hand panel.</p><p>Step 3. Scroll to the bottom of the timeline, and select the latest location update.</p><p>Step 4. If your location is the same as your previous updates, your phone hasn’t moved so you go and get it from that location. Contrarily, if your phone has moved, you should contact authorities, and not go after the thief alone because you never know the type of person they are.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Solution-3-Using-Google-Photos-to-Track-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone 15 Pro"></a>Part 3: Solution 3 - Using Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone 15 Pro</h2><p>If the above Google features do not work for you, the search giant has one more service that can help aka Google Photos.</p><p>This option is somewhat complex, and requires that you have the Google Photos app installed with automatic upload turned on. Further, someone will have to take photos with your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, and in the event it is actually stolen, this is highly unlikely.</p><p>Well, if you have the aforementioned prerequisites, head over to photos.google.com to visit your most recently uploaded photos. If you happen to notice any recent photos, click on them and check their location by clicking on the right sidebar. Again, if you do find the location using this method, it is best to contact your local authorities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075191479909.jpg"                      alt="Use Google Photos to Track your Apple iPhone 15 Pro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing"><a href="#Part-4-Solution-4-Have-another-iPhone-Use-it-to-Track-one-that’s-gone-missing" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Solution 4.

Good news is that starting from iOS 9, this feature is stock and will already be installed on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device.</p><p>Step 1. Open the Find My Friends app on the iPhone that you will use for the tracking, and then enable Share My Location by tapping on their contact picture located at the bottom.</p><p>Ensure that the location is being Shared From This Device as there may be other devices connected with the same iCloud account.</p><p>Step 2. Next enable AirDrop from the control center of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and make yourself discoverable to everyone. Further hit Add on the tracking iPhone, choose your contact icon and select Share Indefinitely.</p><p>Step 3. Once the tracking iPhone’s location is shared with your device, a popup will appear asking you how long you would like to share your location for, which is where you select Share Indefinitely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075192666907.jpg"                      alt="use another phone to track the missing one"                ></p><p>Step 4.
