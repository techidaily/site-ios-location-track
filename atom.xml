While cellphones are meant to give everyone the ability to communicate, their secretive nature can also nurture society’s ills, and children, especially teenagers can fall prey to these. Yet, as a parent, it can be very hard to monitor what your child is doing on your device. That’s why we thought it wise to share with you a few ways you can spy on someone’s text messages from your device or computer.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-another-Android-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-another-Android-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on text messages from another Android phone"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on text messages from another Android phone</h2><p>To spy on another android device’s text messages, you will need to install spy software on that device.

This app allows users to spy on another iPhone without the target device’s owner knowing. It has a major advantage in that it allows the user to see all messages including those the owner of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device may have deleted. You can also see both sent and received messages.</p><p>Here’s how to use Auto Forward to spy on another iPhone’s text messages.</p><p>Step 1: To begin with, download and install Auto Forward onto your computer or another iOS device.</p><p>Step 2: Log in to your account (that you would have created before installing the app) and enter the Apple ID and password of the iPhone you want to spy on.</p><p>Step 3: The app will automatically access all messages on the target device. It will however only work if you have the target device’s Apple login details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074689453332.jpg"                      alt="Spy on text messages from another iPhone via Auto Forward"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-computer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Spy on text messages from computer"></a>Part 3: How to Spy on text messages from computer</h2><p>If you want to spy on someone else’s text messages on your computer, a monitoring program like <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be a good choice. As one of the best spy apps in the business, mSpy gives you the ability to monitor any device both Android and iOS remotely from any computer. It is easy to install and will provide you with additional information about the target device including call history, browsing history, and even email tracking.</p><p>Here’s how to <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >use mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to spy on another phone’s text messages.</p><p>Step 1: You will need to first purchase a mSpy subscription from the program’s website.

The steps are easy to follow.</p><p>Step 3: You should be able to log in to your web-based control panel and view the messages as soon as the installation is complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074696134452.jpg"                      alt="Spy on text messages from computer via mSpy"                ></p><p>The above three solutions enable users to monitor more than just text messages. They give parents the ability to keep track of what their children are saying to one another or who they are talking to.

Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup"                ></p><p>Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.</p><p>Step 4: You can then log in to your <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079748088200.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-log in to your mSpy control panel"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak"></a>Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak</h2><p>Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.</p><p>Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy"                ></p><p>Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the</p><p>device will however make it easier for the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.</p><h2 id="How-to-Intercept-Text-Messages-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Intercept-Text-Messages-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone 14 Pro"></a>How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone 14 Pro</h2><p>With the increase in the use of smartphones nowadays, the applications for smartphones have gone on to become equally smarter. For instance, text messages which are one of the most important components of every phone, can now be easily intercepted or spied on, courtesy some smart applications. Yes, it is a matter of minutes now to be able to spy on or intercept text messages even when not having the target device in your possession. Moreover, there are applications that work on all platforms whether it is android or iOS. But how do you intercept text messages? Well, if this is what’s playing in your mind; you are absolutely at the right place. In this article, we are going to discuss ways to intercept text messages from both iOS and Android Phones and how to know whether your text messages have been intercepted.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended android&#x2F;ios location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Virtual Location - the most trustworthy way to fake GPS on iPhone &#x2F;Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="fake GPS of mobile device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?"></a>Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?</h2><p>Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data. This feature helps when the phone is stolen. Installing mSpy on the target phone is extremely simple and involves very few steps. So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.</p><p><strong>Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones</strong></p><p>To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2.

Once the application is set up, it is going to work invisibly and the target user will never get to know that he is being monitored. The target phone will work normally and mSpy will not interfere in any of the applications installed on the target phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781234928456.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install the application"                ></p><p>Installing in Android</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781239566126.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing in Android"                ></p><p>Installing on iOS</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781241065208.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing on iOS"                ></p><p><strong>3. Start monitoring</strong></p><p>You can now start intercepting the text messages remotely from other phones. Use your account through your login credentials and get reports from the target phone pertaining to text message history, chats, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781244325874.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Start monitoring"                ></p><p>The above screen is the monitoring console through which we can see all the text messages on the target device.

While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up. This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.</p><p>2. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.</p><p>So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy. Hope this helps you in successfully and safely intercepting text messages.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/top-10-best-spy-watches-for-your-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Apple iPhone 6 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/best-anti-tracker-software-for-apple-iphone-6s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Best Anti Tracker Software For Apple iPhone 6s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-9-apple-iphone-14-monitoring-apps-for-parental-controls-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 9 Apple iPhone 14 Monitoring Apps for Parental Controls | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-solutions-to-spy-on-apple-iphone-7-with-and-without-jailbreak-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Solutions to Spy on Apple iPhone 7 with and without jailbreak | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-a-lost-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max for Free?

Apart from navigation, Google Maps can be used for different other applications as well. For instance, you can easily measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also use the Google Maps distance radius feature to focus on a certain area. In this guide, I will let you know how to use Google location distance and radius features in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-1.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps"></a>Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps</h2><p>You might already know that Google Maps provides a map of the entire world for us to navigate. Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.</p><ol><li>Firstly, just go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php" >Map Developers circle tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any supported browser like Google Chrome.

You can also enter the name of the location that you are looking for in the search bar.</li><li>Besides that, you can also enter details about the radius of the circle, its color, and so on. After entering all the needed details, click on the “New Circle” button and it will be reflected on Google Maps interface.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-3.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 3"                ></p><p>If you want, you can later delete this circle or draw multiple circles in different colors to mark them in any location of your choice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps"></a>Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps</h2><p>Apart from drawing a circle or radius on Google Maps, a lot of people would like to specify its distance as well. For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.</p><ul><li><em>Map Developers Radius</em></li></ul><p>Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above. In this, you can just enter the name of a specific place on Google Maps. Now, you can specify the distance of radius in miles or kilometers. This will automatically draw the specific distance radius on Google Maps for the designated location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-4.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 4"                ></p><ul><li><em>KML Circle Generator</em></li></ul><p>If you know the exact longitude and latitude of the place, then you can also take the assistance of KML Circle Generator. In this, you would have to specify the exact coordinates of the place and the Google Maps distance radius value. After entering the relevant details, you can proceed and draw the radius distance on Google Maps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-5.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 5"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Determine-the-Distance-between-two-Addresses-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-3-Determine-the-Distance-between-two-Addresses-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps"></a>Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps</h2><p>This is one of the most resourceful features of Google Maps that a lot of people are not aware of. Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-6.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 6"                ></p><ol><li>Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu. From the available options on the context menu, click on “Measure Distance”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-7.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 7"                ></p><ol><li>Afterward, just click anywhere else on the map and it will automatically find a straight line distance in Google Maps between these two spots.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-8.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 8"                ></p><ol><li>If you want to continue, then just click anywhere else on the map and that will be considered as the next spot. Therefore, you can just click as many times as you want to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-9.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 9"                ></p><p>This technique will let you measure distance between any addresses on Google Maps. It doesn’t matter if it is your present location or not. If you want to measure distance in some other location, then just enter its name in the search bar to load it. In this way, you can measure distance anywhere in the world by sitting in your home.</p><p>This brings us to the end of this extensive guide on using Google Maps distance and radius features. As you can see, I have provided a smart and user-friendly solution to draw radius distance on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also follow the above guide to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. In the same way, you can also let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well.

They can be your spouse or employer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?</h2><p>The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone SE is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone SE device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone SE is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone SE is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone SE is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4. Background Noises"></a><strong>4. Background Noises</strong></h4><p>When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone SE in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone SE device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant.

This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones. The IMEI gets recorded when your mobile device pings off mobile transmission towers that are nearby</p><p>The apps that are used by people to track mobile devices will track one of these two features.

However, you should do this with caution as the information can also be used in a beneficial manner. The best option is to turn on the GPS when you need it and then turn it off when you do not, or use an iOS spoofing tool.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/top-7-phone-number-locators-to-track-apple-iphone-6s-plus-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Top 7 Phone Number Locators To Track Apple iPhone 6s Plus Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/solutions-to-spy-on-apple-iphone-15-with-and-without-jailbreak-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Solutions to Spy on Apple iPhone 15 with and without jailbreak | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-ways-to-track-apple-iphone-se-2020-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 3 Ways to Track Apple iPhone SE (2020) without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-spy-on-text-messages-from-computer-and-apple-iphone-15-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Spy on Text Messages from Computer & Apple iPhone 15 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/top-10-telegram-spy-tools-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-for-parents-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Top 10 Telegram Spy Tools On Apple iPhone 11 Pro for Parents | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-6-appsservices-to-trace-any-apple-iphone-6s-location-by-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 6 Apps/Services to Trace Any Apple iPhone 6s Location By Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-off-google-location-to-stop-tracking-you-on-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-apple-iphone-8-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Apple iPhone 8 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-best-spy-watches-for-your-apple-iphone-14-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Apple iPhone 14 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/solutions-to-spy-on-apple-iphone-13-with-and-without-jailbreak-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Solutions to Spy on Apple iPhone 13 with and without jailbreak | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-turn-off-google-location-to-stop-tracking-you-on-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Apple iPhone 6 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-intercept-text-messages-on-apple-iphone-8-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone 8 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-4-ways-to-trace-apple-iphone-15-plus-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 4 Ways to Trace Apple iPhone 15 Plus Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-find-your-apple-iphone-7-plus-current-location-of-a-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>3 Solutions to Find Your Apple iPhone 7 Plus Current Location of a Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-intercept-text-messages-on-apple-iphone-15-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Intercept Text Messages on Apple iPhone 15 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-i-stop-someone-from-tracking-my-apple-iphone-6s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How Do I Stop Someone From Tracking My Apple iPhone 6s?

For instance, text messages which are one of the most important components of every phone, can now be easily intercepted or spied on, courtesy some smart applications. Yes, it is a matter of minutes now to be able to spy on or intercept text messages even when not having the target device in your possession. Moreover, there are applications that work on all platforms whether it is android or iOS. But how do you intercept text messages? Well, if this is what’s playing in your mind; you are absolutely at the right place. In this article, we are going to discuss ways to intercept text messages from both iOS and Android Phones and how to know whether your text messages have been intercepted.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended android&#x2F;ios location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Virtual Location - the most trustworthy way to fake GPS on iPhone &#x2F;Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="fake GPS of mobile device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?"></a>Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?</h2><p>Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data. This feature helps when the phone is stolen. Installing mSpy on the target phone is extremely simple and involves very few steps. So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.</p><p><strong>Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones</strong></p><p>To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2. Install the application</strong></p><p>After you have received the installation procedures, install <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the target device which will take a few minutes. Once the application is set up, it is going to work invisibly and the target user will never get to know that he is being monitored. The target phone will work normally and mSpy will not interfere in any of the applications installed on the target phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781234928456.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install the application"                ></p><p>Installing in Android</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781239566126.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing in Android"                ></p><p>Installing on iOS</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781241065208.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing on iOS"                ></p><p><strong>3. Start monitoring</strong></p><p>You can now start intercepting the text messages remotely from other phones. Use your account through your login credentials and get reports from the target phone pertaining to text message history, chats, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781244325874.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Start monitoring"                ></p><p>The above screen is the monitoring console through which we can see all the text messages on the target device. The control panel can be opened on any device i.e. phone or computer through the browser using the login credentials.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-you-need-to-know-when-using-mSpy"><a href="#Part-3-What-you-need-to-know-when-using-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What you need to know when using mSpy"></a>Part 3: What you need to know when using mSpy</h2><p><strong>Few things to know when using <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</strong></p><p>While the working, installation, and setting up of mSpy is very easy, there are a few things that need to be kept in mind while using mSpy.</p><p>1. While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up.

Anyone who has web access can obtain information or connect to the rest of the world in two shakes. No need to turn the library upside down just to find what you’re looking for. All it takes is just a few taps on your electronic device to get things done. That’s the simplest explain of how the internet does magic to make our digital world a lot better.</p><p>However, we should never let our guard down whenever we go online and browse the web. We never know. There might be someone on the other side of the world who’s tracking our internet activities and collecting sensitive data. Is it possible to happen? The short answer is absolutely yes. As mentioned earlier, the power of the internet is relatively boundless. Anything, whether good or bad, can take place online in a blink of an eye. Hence, keep your digital footprints private with the aid of <strong>anti-tracker software.</strong></p><p>In this article, we will delve into the essential benefits of anti-tracker software when surfing the internet. We will also provide a list of the <strong>best anti-tracking software</strong> that you can try to use. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Everything-You-Should-Know-About-Anti-Tracker-Software"><a href="#Part-1-Everything-You-Should-Know-About-Anti-Tracker-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Anti-Tracker Software"></a>Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Anti-Tracker Software</h2><p>Just like any other thing in our digital world today, the internet has its good and bad sides. One minute, it can be a solution. The next, it can be a problem. That’s why you should keep everything in check whenever you surf the web. Make sure that you are browsing privately on your device and that no one is watching you somewhere. Is there a feasible way to protect yourself from this kind of cyber intrusion? Fortunately, there is. You can install anti-tracker software on your gadget and activate it whenever you use the internet. By far, it’s doing a great job in this regard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-1.JPG"                      alt="browsing the internet"                ></p><p>Anti-tracker software generally immobilizes suspicious websites or plugins on your browsing device and prevents them from stealing your data online. It’s quite different from Virtual Private Networks because VPNs only encrypt browsing traffic and IP address. But regardless, both of them can indeed help you maintain anonymity when surfing online. Just choose the best anti-tracking software that matches your needs and works perfectly with your situation.</p><p>One way or another, anti-tracker software can be of great help to you. Check out the list of benefits below to understand it very well. For sure, the information provided below can guide you towards the best anti-tracking software options.</p><h3 id="It-restricts-anyone-from-accessing-and-stealing-your-personal-information"><a href="#It-restricts-anyone-from-accessing-and-stealing-your-personal-information" class="headerlink" title="It restricts anyone from accessing and stealing your personal information"></a>It restricts anyone from accessing and stealing your personal information</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-2.JPG"                      alt="sensitive information"                ></p><p>In today’s digital era, where identity theft is rampant everywhere, privacy matters the most. Keeping our personal data away from public access is the least we can do to protect ourselves. That’s why you should consider installing anti-tracker software on your devices. Somehow, it can give you an assurance that the sensitive information you share online is not out in the open. But, of course, choose the best anti-tracking software that is powerful enough to do that for you.</p><h3 id="It-keeps-your-browsing-history-private"><a href="#It-keeps-your-browsing-history-private" class="headerlink" title="It keeps your browsing history private"></a>It keeps your browsing history private</h3><p>What happens if hackers get their hands on your browsing history? Well, there are lots of possibilities, and most of them can directly affect you.

Once the App is downloaded, log in with the details sent to you in your e-mail. mSpy will never send any notifications to the target device and keeps the monitoring process absolutely discrete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081767157541.jpg"                      alt="Monitor Phone Activity with mSpy"                ></p><p>Step 3.

These hackers and sometimes amateurs make use of sophisticated spy software to infiltrate your device and have access to your information. If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device and how to eliminate the threat.

The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.</p><p>It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?</h2><p>The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4. Background Noises"></a><strong>4. Background Noises</strong></h4><p>When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.</p><h2 id="Top-5-Tracking-Apps-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-without-Them-Knowing"><a href="#Top-5-Tracking-Apps-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-without-Them-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Tracking Apps to Track Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max without Them Knowing"></a>Top 5 Tracking Apps to Track Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max without Them Knowing</h2><p>Gone are the days when our smartphones were simply used to perform a few basic tasks.

Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone SE, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone SE via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone SE in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone SE, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone SE from whoever has the phone.

Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches.

Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Check-Distance-and-Radius-on-Google-Maps-For-your-Apple-iPhone-X"><a href="#How-to-Check-Distance-and-Radius-on-Google-Maps-For-your-Apple-iPhone-X" class="headerlink" title="How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Apple iPhone X"></a>How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Apple iPhone X</h2><p><em>“Is it possible to use Google Maps to calculate distance between multiple locations? I want to know the exact distance between different spots, but can’t seem to find any solution!”</em></p><p>If you also wish to use the distance marker on Google Maps, then you might have a similar query like this. Apart from navigation, Google Maps can be used for different other applications as well. For instance, you can easily measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps. Besides that, you can also use the Google Maps distance radius feature to focus on a certain area. In this guide, I will let you know how to use Google location distance and radius features in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-1.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-1-Draw-a-Radius-Circle-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps"></a>Part 1: Draw a Radius Circle on Google Maps</h2><p>You might already know that Google Maps provides a map of the entire world for us to navigate. Though, there are times when users like to draw a radius on Google Maps for a particular location. Presently, the native feature of Google Maps does not have a distance radius tool. Therefore, to draw a radius on Google Maps, you would have to use an application that has its own interface. One of them is Map Developers that is based on Google Maps and has simply provided a solution to draw a radius on the map.</p><ol><li>Firstly, just go to the official website of <a class="link"   href="https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php" >Map Developers circle tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any supported browser like Google Chrome. You can see that the website is based on Google Maps with its added layers to draw a radius on the map.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-2.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 2"                ></p><ol><li>Now, just use the native feature of the map to zoom in to any location of your choice. You can also enter the name of the location that you are looking for in the search bar.</li><li>Besides that, you can also enter details about the radius of the circle, its color, and so on. After entering all the needed details, click on the “New Circle” button and it will be reflected on Google Maps interface.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-3.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 3"                ></p><p>If you want, you can later delete this circle or draw multiple circles in different colors to mark them in any location of your choice.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-2-Determine-the-Distance-with-Radius-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps"></a>Part 2: Determine the Distance with Radius on Google Maps</h2><p>Apart from drawing a circle or radius on Google Maps, a lot of people would like to specify its distance as well. For instance, you might wish to specify a radius of specific miles or kilometers for a place on Google Maps. As stated above, the native feature of Google Maps is presently missing the distance radius feature. The good news is that there are tons of websites out there that have presented the same feature on the original layer of Google Maps.</p><ul><li><em>Map Developers Radius</em></li></ul><p>Consider the example of the circle tool of Map Developers that we have discussed above. In this, you can just enter the name of a specific place on Google Maps. Now, you can specify the distance of radius in miles or kilometers. This will automatically draw the specific distance radius on Google Maps for the designated location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-4.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 4"                ></p><ul><li><em>KML Circle Generator</em></li></ul><p>If you know the exact longitude and latitude of the place, then you can also take the assistance of KML Circle Generator. In this, you would have to specify the exact coordinates of the place and the Google Maps distance radius value. After entering the relevant details, you can proceed and draw the radius distance on Google Maps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-5.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 5"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Determine-the-Distance-between-two-Addresses-on-Google-Maps"><a href="#Part-3-Determine-the-Distance-between-two-Addresses-on-Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps"></a>Part 3: Determine the Distance between two Addresses on Google Maps</h2><p>This is one of the most resourceful features of Google Maps that a lot of people are not aware of. Using its native interface, you can find a straight line distance on Google Maps. That is, it won’t be the driving distance, but the exact distance between 2 places on Google Maps. If you want, you can add other spots to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations as well. To learn how to measure distance between two addresses on Google Maps, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>At first, just launch Google Maps on your system and go to the source location on it. You can click on any marked location or anywhere else on the map. Even if you click on any unmarked location, Google will load its coordinates for you.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-6.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 6"                ></p><ol><li>Now, once the source location is identified, you need to right-click it to get its context menu. From the available options on the context menu, click on “Measure Distance”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-7.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 7"                ></p><ol><li>Afterward, just click anywhere else on the map and it will automatically find a straight line distance in Google Maps between these two spots.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-8.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 8"                ></p><ol><li>If you want to continue, then just click anywhere else on the map and that will be considered as the next spot. Therefore, you can just click as many times as you want to let Google Maps calculate distance between multiple locations.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/google-maps-distance-radius-9.jpg"                      alt="google maps distance radius 9"                ></p><p>This technique will let you measure distance between any addresses on Google Maps. It doesn’t matter if it is your present location or not. If you want to measure distance in some other location, then just enter its name in the search bar to load it. In this way, you can measure distance anywhere in the world by sitting in your home.</p><p>This brings us to the end of this extensive guide on using Google Maps distance and radius features. As you can see, I have provided a smart and user-friendly solution to draw radius distance on Google Maps.

This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.</p><p>You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do people track your phone?"></a>Part 1: How do people track your phone?</h2><p>There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-SE-for-Free"><a href="#How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-SE-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone SE for Free?"></a>How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone SE for Free?</h2><p>A cell phone is a rather small device when compared to other things you may haul around on a daily basis such as a purse or wallet and even a bunch of keys. Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely. However, with the increase in modern mobile technology, there are several apps that can help you track your lost cell phone’s whereabouts. But you’ve already paid a premium price for your cell phone, so what you really should do is learn how to track a lost phone for free?</p><p>And if you haven’t done so already, you should also install apps whether paid or free that do more than GPS location tracking such as monitoring incoming and outgoing calls, text and multimedia messages. So if you’re wondering how to track your lost phone for free, we’ve got a few solutions that will help you do just that, and others that bring to the table a wide range of great features.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?"></a>Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?</h2><p>One of the noteworthy features of iPhones is that they tend to retain great value for many years to come hence they become a preferred choice for prying thieves. Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your Apple iPhone SE can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.</p><p>But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Apple iPhone SE device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Apple iPhone SE device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.</p><p>Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your Apple iPhone SE, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080421681564.jpeg"                      alt="track your lost phone for free with iCloud"                ></p><p>Step 2. Now it’s time to hit the cloud—iCloud we mean! First things first—head to &lt;<a href="http://www.iCloud.com>">www.iCloud.com&gt;</a> from any browser and login with your credentials. From the dashboard, click on Find iPhone in the second row and enter your Apple ID and password if prompted. Since you may have several Apple devices connected with the same iCloud account, click on All Devices at the top, and select the Apple iPhone SE device you wish to track from the dropdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422049397.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for free-click on Find iPhone and All Devices"                ></p><p>Step 3. That’s really all there is to it! Once you select your device, you can do one of three things—play sound, activate lost mode or erase the Apple iPhone SE device to prevent compromise of information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422409247.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for frees-start to track"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?</h2><p>If you’ve misplaced your Android cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Apple iPhone SE device), and locations services on the Apple iPhone SE device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with.

Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services.

Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products? If so, you can start by giving Google access to the location data on your Android smartphone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Imagine you can easily locate a particular place and get directions by simply browsing Google Maps. No need to borrow an Atlas from the library just to find a location you want to visit. However, in exchange for this convenience, you have to share location access with Google. Some users are not confident to access this privilege at the expense of their privacy. Don’t worry. That’s totally fine. If you’re one of them, this article can help you turn off Google location tracking on your Android device. Is there a more conservative approach to address this issue?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-by-Phone-Number"><a href="#How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-by-Phone-Number" class="headerlink" title="How to Track Apple iPhone 11 Pro by Phone Number"></a>How to Track Apple iPhone 11 Pro by Phone Number</h2><p>In most cases, tracking a lost iPhone has always been made possible thanks to the presence of tracking apps, and the use of the IMEI number. However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location - change your mobile device GPS to any place in the world with just 1 click <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number"><a href="#Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?"></a>Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?</h2><p>A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 11 Pro via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 11 Pro in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 11 Pro from whoever has the phone. In this case, the application of <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be highly recommended. The mSpy program is a highly versatile program that can be used to perform various functions depending on the preferences of the user. In our case at hand, you can use this program to track your Apple iPhone 11 Pro regardless of what part of the world the phone could have been taken to or located.</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Please note that you can only track down your Apple iPhone 11 Pro using mSpy by first installing the app on your phone. Without the installation process, tracking your phone using mSpy will be close to impossible.</p><p>The following is a detailed process on how to track an iPhone by number using mSpy phone locating feature.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Purchase-the-App"><a href="#Step-1-Purchase-the-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Purchase the App"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase the App</h4><p>Your first step is to go to the <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download this program and install it on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max from whoever has the phone.

While cellphones are meant to give everyone the ability to communicate, their secretive nature can also nurture society’s ills, and children, especially teenagers can fall prey to these. Yet, as a parent, it can be very hard to monitor what your child is doing on your device. That’s why we thought it wise to share with you a few ways you can spy on someone’s text messages from your device or computer.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-another-Android-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-text-messages-from-another-Android-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on text messages from another Android phone"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on text messages from another Android phone</h2><p>To spy on another android device’s text messages, you will need to install spy software on that device.

You can choose to purchase a 1 monthly&#x2F;3 monthly&#x2F;12 monthly subscription.</p><p>Step 2: Once you’ve registered and paid for your account, you will receive an email with all the information to help you download and install the software.

Either because you are in an unfamiliar city and you did not know how to return, or because you are thinking of something else while parking, you did not pay attention surely more than one occasion. To solve this type of problem, we propose a series of apps to find your car that will surely be useful when you park and make you remember that particular place thanks to the GPS locator for the car so check the following options and choose the best one for you and your car.</p><h2 id="Option-1-Find-My-Car"><a href="#Option-1-Find-My-Car" class="headerlink" title="Option 1: Find My Car"></a>Option 1: Find My Car</h2><p>Introduction: For many, this is one of the most popular apps, perhaps because it is free and is a car locator device available for iOS and Android. When we finish parking, through GPS the app sets your exact position so that to return to the car you just have to consult the map using Google Navigation, which will give us directions to get to the place where we left. In addition, this app permits to you to take photos of the place, add notes and even set a stopwatch in case you have parked in the wrong zone.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Use Google navigation to rich to your car faster.</p><p>Can store all the positions that you want.</p><p>Take photos from the parking location.</p><p>It is a free application</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082184344228.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-find my car"                ></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-my-car/id349510601?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-my-car/id349510601?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elibera.android.findmycar&amp;hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elibera.android.findmycar&amp;hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-2-Parkme"><a href="#Option-2-Parkme" class="headerlink" title="Option 2: Parkme"></a>Option 2: Parkme</h2><p>Introduction: This is another app to find your car with GPS locator for car dedicated to knowing where your car is. It is available for iPhone and Android, it’s free and allows you to help locate a car parking and later find the car. This app has three buttons on the main screen: find parking, save (to know where you parked) and look for the car. Thanks to this option, you have a map and a compass that will help guide you to get to the car. In addition, you can share the location of our car via Facebook, Twitter or SMS.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Vehicle locator connected to your iOS or Android device.</p><p>Can check available parking in your area.</p><p>It is free.</p><p>Can check the parking prices also in real time.</p><p>Has database for more than 500 cities in America, Europe, and more countries.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081722994485.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Parkme"                ></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/parkme-parking/id417605484?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/parkme-parking/id417605484?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parkme.consumer&amp;hl=es" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parkme.consumer&amp;hl=es <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-3-Automatic"><a href="#Option-3-Automatic" class="headerlink" title="Option 3: Automatic"></a>Option 3: Automatic</h2><p>Introduction: This is a car locator device system that helps us find where we parked our car. It works by connecting our car with the mobile phone and allowing us to know at all times the location of our car, something very useful in case of missing or even theft. In addition, in case of an accident, we can notify the emergency services through the same application.</p><p>This app to find your car consists of a sensor connected to the mobile application and all we have to do is install it in the OBD (On Board Diagnostics) port of our vehicle, usually located next to the instrument control or around of the center console. It is available for iOS. Apart from looking for the car, this app allows us to control through Bluetooth also the consumption of gasoline, the effort that has made the engine, if you suffer and how to avoid it while advising us on how to achieve and maintain optimal driving.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Can receive free emergency help in case of a crash.</p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Available in English.</p><p>Compatible with iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch</p><p>Control if you need gasoline through Bluetooth</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723208344.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Automatic"                ></p><p>URL:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version"><a href="#Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)"></a>Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)</h2><p>Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.</p><p>Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Shows available parking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723711372.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Google Maps"                ></p><p>URL is not available yet.</p><h2 id="Option-5-Waze"><a href="#Option-5-Waze" class="headerlink" title="Option 5: Waze"></a>Option 5: Waze</h2><p>Introduction: This app, compatible with Android and iOS is intended for users who go by car.</p><p>It allows to obtain routes and check movements in real time, besides visualizing possible obstacles in your way.</p><p>The application goes beyond navigation because it permits drivers to share road reports on accidents, police checks or any other danger along their way and get information about what is coming also. It uses satellite technology, so it does not require internet. This application helps you to find parking areas when you need one and can be activated as a GPS locator for the car.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>It is a car locator</p><p>Thanks to GPS you can find available parking</p><p>Get information in real-time if there is any problem in the way.</p><p>It is free and very easy to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081724223630.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Waze"                ></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>So, now onwards, you do not need to pay to get a GPS locator for the car, as you can see, there are many available options that you can use and choose to locate your car for free for both iOS and Android devices. You can take our recommendations from these different options. Just connect your car with your device, does not matter it’s operative system and start receiving information on where your car is and about the feasibility of parking area as well.</p><h2 id="How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-Location-without-Installing-Software"><a href="#How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-Location-without-Installing-Software" class="headerlink" title="How to Track Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Location without Installing Software?"></a>How to Track Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Location without Installing Software?</h2><p>There are several reasons why you may want to track cell, whether to check up on your kids to make sure they at the mall and not the pub, or to ensure your employees are indeed stuck in a traffic jam and not at the local casino. Owing to the surge in GPS and mobile technology, tracking your cell phone’s exact location is rather easy given the myriad software available.

However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location - change your mobile device GPS to any place in the world with just 1 click <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number"><a href="#Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?"></a>Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?</h2><p>A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 7, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 7 via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 7 in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 7, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 7 from whoever has the phone. In this case, the application of <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be highly recommended.

From your Apple iPhone 7, head to Settings, then tap your Apple ID, then iCloud, and lastly tap Find My iPhone to activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095192265.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-activate Find My iPhone"                ></p><p>Step 2. Once successfully activated, you can now track your Apple iPhone 7’s whereabouts in Apple’s iCloud from any web browser.</p><p>Step 3. Go to iCloud.com, and then log in using your credentials.</p><p>Step 4. Click on the Find iPhone button located in the second row.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095511390.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-use Apple’s iCloud"                ></p><p>Step 5. From here, you will need to click the dropdown labeled All Devices and select the target device. Once you select the Apple iPhone 7 device you wish to locate, you can either erase your Apple iPhone 7, send an audible alert or lock the Apple iPhone 7 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095893194.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-select the Apple iPhone 7 device you wish to locate"                ></p><h4 id="How-to-Track-a-Cell-Location-using-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#How-to-Track-a-Cell-Location-using-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="How to Track a Cell Location using Android Device Manager?"></a><strong>How to Track a Cell Location using Android Device Manager?</strong></h4><p>If you’re an Android user, Google’s Android Device Manager presently known as Find My Device is activated by default on newer cell phones. Note that if you have an older Android phone, you can download ADM right from the Google Play Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082096225606.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone-use Android Device Manager"                ></p><p>Step 1. As long as you have your Google account connected with your Android device (again something you will have done when you first received the phone), you can now begin tracking by heading to Find My Device on the web.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in with your Google credentials, and you will be greeted with a dashboard that will show you where your cell phone is along with several other options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082099019590.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone-Sign in with your Google credentials"                ></p><p>Step 3. You can now do one of three things apart from viewing your cell location i.e. play sound, lock or erase device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082099518488.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-view your cell location"                ></p><h4 id="Another-Google-Solution"><a href="#Another-Google-Solution" class="headerlink" title="Another Google Solution:"></a><strong>Another Google Solution:</strong></h4><p>Google recently has implemented some of the ADM features right into the web browser, meaning you can simply as the Search Giant to locate it for you from a simple web search. Of course, you will have to be logged into your Google account for this solution to work.</p><p>Step 1. Open the main Google search page and type in “find My Apple iPhone 7”, and you should be presented with results showing your cell phone’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082098089360.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone-type in "                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Track-a-Cell-Phone-Location-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Track-a-Cell-Phone-Location-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Track a Cell Phone Location via mSpy?"></a>Part 3: How to Track a Cell Phone Location via mSpy?</h2><p>We’ve just given you two solutions to how to track a cell phone location without installing software, but they are limited in the features they offer, meaning you can just check cell phone location. But there may be times when you may feel the need to get a comprehensive look or rather a mirror image of what your cell phone is being used for. And for that, there is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an app that allows you to not only track Your Apple iPhone 7 location but rings in with several other handy features.</p><p>Billed as the ultimate software for parental control, <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows PC and MAC OS and is easily accessible from any web browser. It is easy to install and if you experience any hiccups, you can always refer to the free online help. Further, it is available in several countries and backed by stellar multi-language customer support. mSpy offers three unique plans to choose from, each with its rich set of features that include the ability to manage calls, track text messages, read emails, track GPS location, monitor browsing history and internet use, control apps and programs and read instant messages from the app such as WhatsApp for a grand total of 24 features.</p><p>Step 1. After selecting the right plan for your needs, you will have to register the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100202731.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-register the software"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, you will have to set up the app with information on your target device and that’s it! You can now access the mSpy dashboard and begin tracking your cell phone location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100515661.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-setup the app"                ></p><p>Step 3. You can select from several options in the left hand, two of the most noteworthy being geo-fencing and WhatsApp. Geo-fencing is a great feature to monitor both your kids and employees and basically, allows you to set up parameters and alert you when they are breached.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100786594.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-select from several options"                ></p><p>WhatsApp is a highly secure chat application, but mSpy backed by the latest technology also allows you to monitor its messages both incoming and outgoing. Simply click on the WhatsApp tab and you will be presented with a list of WhatsApp messages that you can further sort through by date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082101238393.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-sort through WhatsApp messages by date"                ></p><p>There are several instances such as in the excitement of getting a new phone that we may overlook the need to install software to track a cell phone. But both Google and Apple are generous enough to offer a solution to track your cell phone location without having to install any third-party software. But if you’re like to do a lot more than just track your cell phone’s location, mSpy with its expensive list of features sets the gold standard in this space.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/top-5-tracking-apps-to-track-apple-iphone-14-plus-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Top 5 Tracking Apps to Track Apple iPhone 14 Plus without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-whatsapp-messages-on-apple-iphone-se-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track WhatsApp Messages on Apple iPhone SE Without Them Knowing?

This can be done by tracking the phone number based on information derived from mobile carriers and also from the GPS chip on the phone which is used by certain apps in order to function well.</p><p>You may not want your GPS location tracked by anyone or by apps on your device. When playing games like Pokémon Go, the geo-location data on your device is used to pinpoint where you are for purposes of gameplay. In the same manner, malicious people can track you same way. Here you will learn how to stop someone from tracking your phone in simple and easy ways.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-people-track-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do people track your phone?"></a>Part 1: How do people track your phone?</h2><p>There are several ways in which people can track the location of your phone. This can be risky at times, especially if you have a stalker. These are the common ways in which people track phones:</p><p>GPS location: all Smartphones come with a GPS chip, which continually gives the GPS location of your device. This is great for several features to work on the phone, but it can also be exploited by malicious people. The GPS location is also used to find lost devices or persons who are challenged in finding directions and may get lost. Therefore the GPS chip function is a double-edged sword.</p><p>IMEI information: This is information that can be tracked using data that is found on your mobile provider’s servers. This is the information that law enforcers use to track crooks, and rescue teams use to track people lost in disaster zones.

To avoid any unforeseen situation, it is recommended to inform them before installing the app.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/9-best-phone-monitoring-apps-for-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>9 Best Phone Monitoring Apps for Apple iPhone 13 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-car-locator-apps-for-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 5 Car Locator Apps for Apple iPhone 6 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-apple-iphone-14-plus-by-phone-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track Apple iPhone 14 Plus by Phone Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-off-google-location-to-stop-tracking-you-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Apple iPhone 11 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-apple-iphone-7-by-phone-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track Apple iPhone 7 by Phone Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-detect-and-remove-spyware-on-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 6?

For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location. Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services. That’s indeed beneficial to all of us, especially in today’s ever-changing world. But definitely, it’s not possible if Google doesn’t have adequate location information from the pool of its users. Why so? Simply because location data determines the latest community trends and helps specialists find the perfect basis for fresh developments. Do you want to contribute something to the advancement of Google products? If so, you can start by giving Google access to the location data on your Android smartphone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Top-4-Techniques-to-Turn-Off-Google-Location-Tracking-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Top 4 Techniques to Turn Off Google Location Tracking on Android</h2><p>There’s no denying that Google uses location information to give us the best experience possible. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean there is no risk at all. We cannot rule out the possibility of data breaches and disclosure of location information that is supposed to be private. If you’re worried about this kind of situation, you can prevent it from happening in a snap of a finger. Check out the four methods below on how to turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-off-the-location-services-on-your-Android-mobile-device"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-off-the-location-services-on-your-Android-mobile-device" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn off the location services on your Android mobile device"></a>Method 1: Turn off the location services on your Android mobile device</h3><p>“How to stop Google from tracking me?” Well, it’s actually very easy. You just need to deactivate the location service on your Android mobile device. After that, Google and other GPS-based applications on your smartphone will immediately lose access to your location data. Do you want to try it now?

That’s fine. There is a way to deactivate the Google app’s location permission while the other apps remain unaffected. Are you more inclined to implement this decentralized approach? Check out the tutorial provided below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your Android smartphone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click <strong>Apps.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-5.jpg"                      alt="app list"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find and click <strong>Google</strong> on the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-6.jpg"                      alt="google on app list"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click <strong>Permissions.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-7.jpg"                      alt="google app permissions"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Click <strong>Location.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-8.jpg"                      alt="location access for google"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Lastly, click <strong>Don’t Allow.</strong> Alternatively, you may instead select <strong>Allow Only While Using the App</strong> or <strong>Ask Every Time</strong> if you wish to grant Google conditional access to your location data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-9.jpg"                      alt="disallow location access on google"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Toggle-off-the-Timeline-feature-on-your-Google-Account"><a href="#Method-3-Toggle-off-the-Timeline-feature-on-your-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Toggle off the Timeline feature on your Google Account"></a>Method 3: Toggle off the Timeline feature on your Google Account</h3><p>Timeline is a special Google feature that keeps a record of your location check-ins and routes taken for future reference.

It works by connecting our car with the mobile phone and allowing us to know at all times the location of our car, something very useful in case of missing or even theft. In addition, in case of an accident, we can notify the emergency services through the same application.</p><p>This app to find your car consists of a sensor connected to the mobile application and all we have to do is install it in the OBD (On Board Diagnostics) port of our vehicle, usually located next to the instrument control or around of the center console. It is available for iOS. Apart from looking for the car, this app allows us to control through Bluetooth also the consumption of gasoline, the effort that has made the engine, if you suffer and how to avoid it while advising us on how to achieve and maintain optimal driving.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Can receive free emergency help in case of a crash.</p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Available in English.</p><p>Compatible with iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch</p><p>Control if you need gasoline through Bluetooth</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723208344.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Automatic"                ></p><p>URL:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version"><a href="#Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)"></a>Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)</h2><p>Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.</p><p>Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Shows available parking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723711372.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Google Maps"                ></p><p>URL is not available yet.</p><h2 id="Option-5-Waze"><a href="#Option-5-Waze" class="headerlink" title="Option 5: Waze"></a>Option 5: Waze</h2><p>Introduction: This app, compatible with Android and iOS is intended for users who go by car.</p><p>It allows to obtain routes and check movements in real time, besides visualizing possible obstacles in your way.</p><p>The application goes beyond navigation because it permits drivers to share road reports on accidents, police checks or any other danger along their way and get information about what is coming also.
