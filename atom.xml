It is available for iPhone and Android, it’s free and allows you to help locate a car parking and later find the car. This app has three buttons on the main screen: find parking, save (to know where you parked) and look for the car. Thanks to this option, you have a map and a compass that will help guide you to get to the car. In addition, you can share the location of our car via Facebook, Twitter or SMS.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Vehicle locator connected to your iOS or Android device.</p><p>Can check available parking in your area.</p><p>It is free.</p><p>Can check the parking prices also in real time.</p><p>Has database for more than 500 cities in America, Europe, and more countries.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081722994485.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Parkme"                ></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/parkme-parking/id417605484?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/parkme-parking/id417605484?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parkme.consumer&amp;hl=es" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parkme.consumer&amp;hl=es <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-3-Automatic"><a href="#Option-3-Automatic" class="headerlink" title="Option 3: Automatic"></a>Option 3: Automatic</h2><p>Introduction: This is a car locator device system that helps us find where we parked our car. It works by connecting our car with the mobile phone and allowing us to know at all times the location of our car, something very useful in case of missing or even theft. In addition, in case of an accident, we can notify the emergency services through the same application.</p><p>This app to find your car consists of a sensor connected to the mobile application and all we have to do is install it in the OBD (On Board Diagnostics) port of our vehicle, usually located next to the instrument control or around of the center console. It is available for iOS. Apart from looking for the car, this app allows us to control through Bluetooth also the consumption of gasoline, the effort that has made the engine, if you suffer and how to avoid it while advising us on how to achieve and maintain optimal driving.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Can receive free emergency help in case of a crash.</p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Available in English.</p><p>Compatible with iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch</p><p>Control if you need gasoline through Bluetooth</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723208344.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Automatic"                ></p><p>URL:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version"><a href="#Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)"></a>Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)</h2><p>Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.</p><p>Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Shows available parking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723711372.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Google Maps"                ></p><p>URL is not available yet.</p><h2 id="Option-5-Waze"><a href="#Option-5-Waze" class="headerlink" title="Option 5: Waze"></a>Option 5: Waze</h2><p>Introduction: This app, compatible with Android and iOS is intended for users who go by car.</p><p>It allows to obtain routes and check movements in real time, besides visualizing possible obstacles in your way.</p><p>The application goes beyond navigation because it permits drivers to share road reports on accidents, police checks or any other danger along their way and get information about what is coming also. It uses satellite technology, so it does not require internet. This application helps you to find parking areas when you need one and can be activated as a GPS locator for the car.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>It is a car locator</p><p>Thanks to GPS you can find available parking</p><p>Get information in real-time if there is any problem in the way.</p><p>It is free and very easy to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081724223630.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Waze"                ></p><p>URL for Android:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en" >https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&amp;hl=en <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>URL for iPhone:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>So, now onwards, you do not need to pay to get a GPS locator for the car, as you can see, there are many available options that you can use and choose to locate your car for free for both iOS and Android devices. You can take our recommendations from these different options. Just connect your car with your device, does not matter it’s operative system and start receiving information on where your car is and about the feasibility of parking area as well.</p><h2 id="Two-Ways-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-without-Him-Knowing"><a href="#Two-Ways-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-without-Him-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend’s Apple iPhone 6s Plus without Him Knowing"></a>Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend’s Apple iPhone 6s Plus without Him Knowing</h2><p>How can I track my boyfriend’s phone? If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?"></a>Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?</h2><p>When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy"                ></p><p>1. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.</p><p>2. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.</p><p>3. Go to its Settings &gt; Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600151360.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-download from Unknown Sources"                ></p><p>4. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.</p><p>5. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.</p><p>6. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600392625.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-access its web-based dashboard"                ></p><p>Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?"></a>Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?</h2><p>As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – <a class="link"   href="https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/" >KidsGuard Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Secondly, after buying the product, you need to download the KidsGuard Pro app on your target device. Please go to the My Products and Orders Management page and click “Setup Guide” to follow the instructions carefully and complete all settings on the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/click-android-setup-guide.jpg"                      alt="complete the settings"                ></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXtNaHFBoXo" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>3. Great! Now all you need to do is log in to your KidsGuard Pro account on their website using your account credentials. On the home page, you can access all the major information related to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device like its location, frequent callers, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/android-control-panel.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-log-in to KidsGuard Pro’s dashboard"                ></p><p>4. Furthermore, you can simply visit the desired section from the left panel to get in-depth access. For instance, by visiting the “Locations” section, you can view the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, the previously visited places, and more.</p><p>After following these instructions, I was also able to track my boyfriend without much trouble.

But real spy work actually happens behind a computer screen. In the age of information technology, people keep all their most valuable information stored on phones.

Watches make for the perfect and most discreet spy gadgets because they are constantly on your wrist, they can hide in plain sight, and they are large enough to accommodate a good camera and memory card.</p><p>If you would like to record a meeting discreetly and use it later to your advantage, you can’t go wrong with a spy watch on your wrists. You can look through several different spy watches online, but the vast number of models can get disconcerting. That’s why we’ve taken the liberty to list out the 10 best spy watches that you should be looking out for.

But real spy work actually happens behind a computer screen. In the age of information technology, people keep all their most valuable information stored on phones. As such, if you have access to someone’s phone, you have access to all their secrets. However, breaking into someone’s phone doesn’t require years of hacking and coding practice as most people believe. All you need is a decent app that can take care of everything for you. <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that app.</p><p>While there are a lot of other spy apps out there worth browsing through, both for Android and <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/track/iphone-monitoring.html" >iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, mSpy is the most reliable, reasonable, and feature-heavy of them all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14830056776035.jpg"                      alt="best spy watches"                ></p><h3 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h3><ol><li>It comes with a lot of <a class="link"   href="https://www.mspy.com/features.html" >features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches. How so? Well, Google immediately sends alerts whenever your account is used from an unusual location.

With the advancement in technology, we can use them to access our emails on the go, share updates on social media, and do so much more.

Nevertheless, if you are tracking someone else’s smartphone, then you should be aware of the consequences. To avoid any unforeseen situation, it is recommended to inform them before installing the app.</p><h2 id="Two-Ways-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-without-Him-Knowing"><a href="#Two-Ways-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-without-Him-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend’s Apple iPhone 6s Plus without Him Knowing"></a>Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend’s Apple iPhone 6s Plus without Him Knowing</h2><p>How can I track my boyfriend’s phone? If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?"></a>Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?</h2><p>When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy"                ></p><p>1. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.</p><p>2. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.</p><p>3. Go to its Settings &gt; Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600151360.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-download from Unknown Sources"                ></p><p>4. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.</p><p>5. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.</p><p>6. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600392625.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-access its web-based dashboard"                ></p><p>Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?"></a>Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?</h2><p>As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – <a class="link"   href="https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/" >KidsGuard Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It provided a highly reliable and secure way to track a device’s location, its vital content, and so much more. Easy to download and use, KidsGuard Pro doesn’t require you to root your Android device. After installing it on the target device, you can track it from the web dashboard control panel remotely.</p><p>Since it runs in stealth mode, it allowed me to track my boyfriend’s phone without getting detected. Besides his real-time location, I was able to know his call logs, contacts, photos, social media activity, and so much more in one place. It allowed me to track my boyfriend in a trouble-free manner. You can also do the same by following these steps:</p><p>1. Firstly, visit KidsGuard Pro’s official website right <a class="link"   href="https://panel.clevguard.com/sign-up?dev_tp=android" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your new account. You need to sign-up with your email id and set up a strong password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/create-an-account-for-clevguard.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-sign up KidsGuard Pro "                ></p><p>2. Secondly, after buying the product, you need to download the KidsGuard Pro app on your target device. Please go to the My Products and Orders Management page and click “Setup Guide” to follow the instructions carefully and complete all settings on the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/click-android-setup-guide.jpg"                      alt="complete the settings"                ></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXtNaHFBoXo" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>3. Great! Now all you need to do is log in to your KidsGuard Pro account on their website using your account credentials. On the home page, you can access all the major information related to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device like its location, frequent callers, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/android-control-panel.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-log-in to KidsGuard Pro’s dashboard"                ></p><p>4. Furthermore, you can simply visit the desired section from the left panel to get in-depth access. For instance, by visiting the “Locations” section, you can view the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, the previously visited places, and more.</p><p>After following these instructions, I was also able to track my boyfriend without much trouble. KidsGuard Pro also provides a seamless way to track the social media activity on the target device, record calls, listen to its surroundings, etc. Furthermore, you can enable its Keylogging feature as well to get a comprehensive record of everything typed on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. By using these amazing features, I was able to track my boyfriend’s phone without getting detected.</p><p>Since KidsGuard Pro is compatible with all the leading Android and iOS devices, you can take its assistance without facing any setbacks. I used it to track my boyfriend’s phone and so can you. Nevertheless, before you proceed, make sure that you are not doing anything illegal. You should either own the phone you are tracking or inform the other person beforehand. This will prevent you from any unforeseen situation. Now when you know better, you can easily use KidsGuard Pro to track any Android or iOS device.

Many spy or monitoring programs make it easy. All you have do is have access to the iPhone you want to spy on and have a reliable spy program. The problem is, there are some spy programs that will only work on a jailbroken device. This can be a problem when you don’t want the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s owner to know of your activities and the owner has no intention to jailbreak their device.</p><p>In this article, we look at how you to spy on an iPhone without needing a jailbreak and how to spy on a jailbroken device or jailbreak a device to facilitate spying.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Spy-on-iPhone-without-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak"></a>Part 1: How to Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak</h2><p>The majority of spy apps in the market will only work on a jailbroken device or require you to jailbreak an iPhone before you can use them. While a jailbroken device does have its advantages, it can be quite problematic when you want to spy on an iPhone without alerting the owner to your activities. To begin with, you must have the iPhone to jailbreak it, a factor that makes it easier to get caught trying to spy on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. Also, it is quite possible no matter how hard you try to hide the jailbreaking app that the owner will realize you have jailbroken their device.</p><p>For the best results you want to use a monitoring program that doesn’t require a jailbroken device to work. The best is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a monitoring program that will work on any iPhone and provide you with detailed information without the need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. Here’s how to use mSpy to spy on an iPhone.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by activating iCloud Backup on the target device. Go to Settings and then select “iCloud” to do this. Using mSpy will require iCloud to be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079744896475.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-activate iCloud Backup"                ></p><p>Step 2: The first step is to create an account with mSpy. You can then purchase a subscription based on the type of information you need from the target device and the duration you want to spend spying on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079746911961.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-create an account with mSpy"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once you’ve registered and purchased the subscription, you will receive an email from mSpy with all the information you need to install the program.</p><p>Step 4: You can then log in to your <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> control panel and add the Apple ID and password of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device to gain access to the information you need on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079748088200.jpg"                      alt="Spy on iPhone without Jailbreak-log in to your mSpy control panel"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spy-using-Spyware-that-Requires-a-Jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak"></a>Part 2: How to Spy using Spyware that Requires a Jailbreak</h2><p>Being able to spy on an iPhone without a jailbreak is not something that happens often. This is because unlike mSpy, most monitoring software will require you jailbreak the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device before you can install the software. One of those apps is TruthSpy. Like mSpy, this app will allow users to see all types of data on the target device without the owner of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device knowing they are being monitored. The only problem is, you need to have access to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device to jailbreak it. If this is what you prefer or are unable to get access to mSpy, TruthSpy will work just fine. Here’s how to use it.</p><p>Step 1: Begin by performing a jailbreak on the target device. There are several options to help you do that like Pangu software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074779011456.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-Pangu software"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is successfully jailbroken, create an account with TruthSpy, purchase a subscription and you will receive instructions on how to install the software on the jailbroken device.</p><p>Step 3: You can then log in to TurthSpy with your log in information and access all types of data on the target iPhone from any bowser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079742762274.jpg"                      alt="Spy using Spyware with jailbreak-log in to TurthSpy"                ></p><p>Both mSpy and TruthSpy will provide you with all the information you need about the target device. The only difference is, you need to jailbreak the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device if TruthSpy will be able to access it. Jailbreaking the</p><p>device will however make it easier for the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s owner to find the spyware and remove it before you are able to complete your activities. It is therefore preferable to use a program like mSpy that requires no jailbreak.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-apple-iphone-12-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Apple iPhone 12 Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-apple-iphone-15-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Apple iPhone 15 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-best-spy-watches-for-your-apple-iphone-13-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Apple iPhone 13 mini | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-off-google-location-to-stop-tracking-you-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Apple iPhone 13 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-7-phone-number-locators-to-track-apple-iphone-se-2022-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 7 Phone Number Locators To Track Apple iPhone SE (2022) Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-apple-iphone-xs-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Apple iPhone XS Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-9-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-monitoring-apps-for-parental-controls-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 9 Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Monitoring Apps for Parental Controls | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-a-lost-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max for Free?

For instance, you can use Google Maps to check a particular place you want to visit and obtain reliable directions to help you get there. Another thing, Google can also give you the exact location of your Android device in case you lost it somewhere. Indeed, Google’s GPS tracking feature comes in very handy whenever you need such assistance.</p><p>It’s true to say that Google’s location monitoring services offer tons of benefits to us. But at some point, we cannot deny that activating this feature somehow entails a certain privacy and security risk. That’s why many users opt to <strong>turn off Google location tracking</strong> and keep their whereabouts private. Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. You can implement such measures, too, if you’re uncomfortable sharing your location details with Google. All it takes to turn off Google location tracking is just a few taps on your mobile device.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Google employs location access on your mobile device. We will also provide some quick tutorials on how to turn off Google location tracking in easy steps. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-How-Google-Uses-Location-Data" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data"></a>Part 1. Understanding How Google Uses Location Data</h2><p>Location data generally helps us find reliable directions and pinpoint a particular place. But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons.

It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking.

These hackers and sometimes amateurs make use of sophisticated spy software to infiltrate your device and have access to your information. If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device and how to eliminate the threat. This article will help you with both.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?"></a>Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?</h2><p>The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.</p><p>It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?</h2><p>The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3.

If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4. Background Noises"></a><strong>4. Background Noises</strong></h4><p>When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone 6s Plus in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-apple-iphone-7-plus-by-phone-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track Apple iPhone 7 Plus by Phone Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/top-10-telegram-spy-tools-on-apple-iphone-8-for-parents-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Top 10 Telegram Spy Tools On Apple iPhone 8 for Parents | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-apple-iphone-6-plus-location-by-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Track Apple iPhone 6 Plus Location by Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-7-phone-number-locators-to-track-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-location-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Top 7 Phone Number Locators To Track Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max Location | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-a-lost-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max for Free?

For android devices, the root service is required for certain advanced features.</p><p>After installing the Flexispy on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you want to monitor, all the relevant information you want to monitor (GPS location, calls, texts) will upload to its server without knowing. The only thing you need to do is log in to your Flexispy account and click “Location” if you would like to track a cell phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/track-cell-phone-with-flexispy-02.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-the flexispy"                ></p><p>Except for viewing the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device location data, you can also export GPS data to use on the mapping application you like.</p><p>How to Export GPS data:</p><p>Step 1: Click the “Export” button on the upper right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/track-cell-phone-with-flexispy-03.jpg"                      alt="export gps data"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click the “Download” button on the pop-up window that appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/track-cell-phone-with-flexispy-04.jpg"                      alt="download gps datay"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-secretly-track-someone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-secretly-track-someone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to secretly track someone"></a>Part 3: How to secretly track someone</h2><p>If you want to track a cell phone without them knowing secretly, then one interesting solution is the “Find my friends” app introduced by Apple though primarily not for spying purposes, but you can use it to spy on someone’s iPhone secretly. This app comes with the facility to get a notification when the target person arrives or leaves a place. Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p>Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone. To enable share my location, open the app “Find my friends” &gt; Go for the contact’s photo &gt; “Share my location”.</p><p>Step 2: Generally iCloud account has sharing options for all other devices. We have to ensure the sharing option is correctly viewed as the target device such as “This device”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100182891050.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-share my location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now swipe from bottom to end, click on the “Airdrop” option from the settings. You will have two options such as “Everyone” and “Contacts only”.</p><p>Step 4: Move to the target device, in the “Find my friends” app click the option “add”. Now your contact picture will get displayed. Click on your profile photo &gt; select the option “Share indefinitely” to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183209840.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-Share indefinitely"                ></p><p>Step 5: The target device location will be shared with you.

To help you out, read the tips provided below and use them as your guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/anti-tracker-software-9.JPG"                      alt="safe internet browsing"                ></p><ul><li>Choose the anti-tracker software that is easy to use. It should require complicated procedures to enable certain features. Moreover, the interface must be intuitive, along with the toolbars and other functions.</li><li>The anti-tracker software should not downgrade the performance of your device. Web pages must continue to load normally. Another thing, web sessions must not be interrupted when the tracker blocker is activated.</li><li>The anti-tracker software must provide comprehensive results with accurate information and meaningful evaluation. It must tell you head-on if your device is compromised and how to fix it.</li><li>The anti-tracker software must be effective. Do some random tests to verify if your online information is completely cloaked when the application is enabled.</li><li>Lastly, the company behind your selected anti-tracker software must provide great customer service. Take note that you’re paying for the subscription plan. Therefore, you deserve to be accommodated promptly when you try to reach them. On top of that, customer service representatives must also be trained enough to handle your concerns. They must be able to provide effective solutions to any issues related to the services they provide.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Keep-Your-Location-Private-With-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-4-Keep-Your-Location-Private-With-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Keep Your Location Private With Wondershare Dr.Fone."></a>Part 4. Keep Your Location Private With <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone.</u></a></h2><p>When it comes to your whereabouts, the anti-tracker software can somehow help you, too. However, the protection is not a hundred percent guaranteed, especially if the attacker employs highly advanced mechanisms. Some details referring to your exact location might remain traceable on their end. That’s why you should opt for alternative solutions with a much higher caliber. In this regard, Wondershare Dr.Fone has a lot to offer to you. It has a Virtual Location feature, allowing you to register another location on your mobile device and simulate GPS movements. Don’t worry. Like the anti-tracker software, it is also very easy to use. Do you want to try it now? Check out the tutorial below.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>official website.</u></a> After that, install it on your computer.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Launch the newly installed application on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your smartphone using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions and perform each step accordingly to ensure the connection between the two devices is stable enough to handle the subsequent procedures.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the left-side panel and then click <strong>Toolbox.</strong> Then, head over to the main dashboard and click <strong>Virtual Location.</strong> Is it your first time accessing this feature? If so, allow Wondershare Dr.Fone to download additional resources from the server. Don’t sweat. It will only take a few minutes to complete.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Immediately after completing the downloading process, Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location feature will open on a separate window. From there, navigate to the top-right menu bar and then click <strong>Teleport Mode.</strong> It is the first icon in the row.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="wondershare drfone teleport mode"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Hover over to the top-left corner of your screen and then enter your desired location into the search bar.

After that, click the <strong>Enter</strong> icon to proceed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search location"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The details about your selected location will be displayed on the screen, together with a corresponding map marker. Read the information and make sure that it is exactly the place you’re looking for. Once confirmed, click <strong>Move Here</strong> to continue.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="location details"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> The location settings on your device will then be changed, and register the location you’ve selected on your computer. From there, you can now browse the internet without worrying that somebody might be spying on your whereabouts.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png"                      alt="location change"                ></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you wish to restore your original location settings, simply close Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and restart your mobile device.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It’s true that a part of you is out in the open once you go online and surf the internet.

But what if you didn’t have any software installed to begin with when you lost your cell phone? So the big question that’s probably on your mind is how to track a cell phone location without installing software? And the good news is that there are several ways to track a cell phone’s mobile location without having to install software, so let’s get right to what we feel are great solutions.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-Cell-Phone-using-Spyera"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-Cell-Phone-using-Spyera" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track Cell Phone using Spyera?"></a>Part 1: How to Track Cell Phone using Spyera?</h2><p>Making it to the top of the list is none other than <a class="link"   href="https://spyera.com/features/" >Spyera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a highly acclaimed piece of software that allows you to do a whole lot more than just check cell phone location.

One of the noteworthy features of Spyera is that it is available in a choice of two plans (monthly and annual plans) and is easy to install, works great on both Android and iOS platforms, and allows you to track cell phone location remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/clone-phone-number-spyera.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone using Spyera"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-A-Cell-Phone-Location-without-Installing-Software"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-A-Cell-Phone-Location-without-Installing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track A Cell Phone Location without Installing Software?"></a>Part 2: How to Track A Cell Phone Location without Installing Software?</h2><h4 id="How-to-Track-a-Cell-Location-using-iCloud"><a href="#How-to-Track-a-Cell-Location-using-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="How to Track a Cell Location using iCloud?"></a><strong>How to Track a Cell Location using iCloud?</strong></h4><p>Apple ships most of its phone with its Find My iPhone feature, for which to work, it will have t be activated on your target device before it goes astray. In most cases, you will have activated this feature already as soon as you unboxed the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, but if you haven’t, here are a few steps to complete the process.</p><p>Step 1. From your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, head to Settings, then tap your Apple ID, then iCloud, and lastly tap Find My iPhone to activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095192265.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-activate Find My iPhone"                ></p><p>Step 2. Once successfully activated, you can now track your Apple iPhone 6s Plus’s whereabouts in Apple’s iCloud from any web browser.</p><p>Step 3. Go to iCloud.com, and then log in using your credentials.</p><p>Step 4. Click on the Find iPhone button located in the second row.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095511390.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-use Apple’s iCloud"                ></p><p>Step 5. From here, you will need to click the dropdown labeled All Devices and select the target device. Once you select the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you wish to locate, you can either erase your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, send an audible alert or lock the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082095893194.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-select the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you wish to locate"                ></p><h4 id="How-to-Track-a-Cell-Location-using-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#How-to-Track-a-Cell-Location-using-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="How to Track a Cell Location using Android Device Manager?"></a><strong>How to Track a Cell Location using Android Device Manager?</strong></h4><p>If you’re an Android user, Google’s Android Device Manager presently known as Find My Device is activated by default on newer cell phones. Note that if you have an older Android phone, you can download ADM right from the Google Play Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082096225606.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone-use Android Device Manager"                ></p><p>Step 1. As long as you have your Google account connected with your Android device (again something you will have done when you first received the phone), you can now begin tracking by heading to Find My Device on the web.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in with your Google credentials, and you will be greeted with a dashboard that will show you where your cell phone is along with several other options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082099019590.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone-Sign in with your Google credentials"                ></p><p>Step 3. You can now do one of three things apart from viewing your cell location i.e. play sound, lock or erase device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082099518488.jpeg"                      alt="track a cell phone-view your cell location"                ></p><h4 id="Another-Google-Solution"><a href="#Another-Google-Solution" class="headerlink" title="Another Google Solution:"></a><strong>Another Google Solution:</strong></h4><p>Google recently has implemented some of the ADM features right into the web browser, meaning you can simply as the Search Giant to locate it for you from a simple web search. Of course, you will have to be logged into your Google account for this solution to work.</p><p>Step 1. Open the main Google search page and type in “find My Apple iPhone 6s Plus”, and you should be presented with results showing your cell phone’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082098089360.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone-type in "                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Track-a-Cell-Phone-Location-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Track-a-Cell-Phone-Location-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Track a Cell Phone Location via mSpy?"></a>Part 3: How to Track a Cell Phone Location via mSpy?</h2><p>We’ve just given you two solutions to how to track a cell phone location without installing software, but they are limited in the features they offer, meaning you can just check cell phone location. But there may be times when you may feel the need to get a comprehensive look or rather a mirror image of what your cell phone is being used for. And for that, there is <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an app that allows you to not only track Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus location but rings in with several other handy features.</p><p>Billed as the ultimate software for parental control, <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows PC and MAC OS and is easily accessible from any web browser. It is easy to install and if you experience any hiccups, you can always refer to the free online help. Further, it is available in several countries and backed by stellar multi-language customer support. mSpy offers three unique plans to choose from, each with its rich set of features that include the ability to manage calls, track text messages, read emails, track GPS location, monitor browsing history and internet use, control apps and programs and read instant messages from the app such as WhatsApp for a grand total of 24 features.</p><p>Step 1. After selecting the right plan for your needs, you will have to register the software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100202731.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-register the software"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, you will have to set up the app with information on your target device and that’s it! You can now access the mSpy dashboard and begin tracking your cell phone location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100515661.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-setup the app"                ></p><p>Step 3. You can select from several options in the left hand, two of the most noteworthy being geo-fencing and WhatsApp. Geo-fencing is a great feature to monitor both your kids and employees and basically, allows you to set up parameters and alert you when they are breached.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082100786594.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-select from several options"                ></p><p>WhatsApp is a highly secure chat application, but mSpy backed by the latest technology also allows you to monitor its messages both incoming and outgoing. Simply click on the WhatsApp tab and you will be presented with a list of WhatsApp messages that you can further sort through by date.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082101238393.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone via mSpy-sort through WhatsApp messages by date"                ></p><p>There are several instances such as in the excitement of getting a new phone that we may overlook the need to install software to track a cell phone. But both Google and Apple are generous enough to offer a solution to track your cell phone location without having to install any third-party software. But if you’re like to do a lot more than just track your cell phone’s location, mSpy with its expensive list of features sets the gold standard in this space.</p><h2 id="How-to-Detect-and-Remove-Spyware-on-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus"><a href="#How-to-Detect-and-Remove-Spyware-on-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 6s Plus?"></a>How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Apple iPhone 6s Plus?</h2><p>As scary as it sounds, it is actually quite possible that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. These hackers and sometimes amateurs make use of sophisticated spy software to infiltrate your device and have access to your information. If you have reason to suspect that someone might have access to your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, it is important to take the steps to figure out just how they gained access to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device and how to eliminate the threat. This article will help you with both.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Spy-on-my-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?"></a>Part 1: Can Someone Spy on my iPhone?</h2><p>The biggest question most iPhone users have is; can someone spy on my iPhone? The truth is, it is actually quite easy to spy on an iPhone remotely thanks to the availability of many kinds of spy or monitoring programs. A hacker can also gain access to your device’s information through phishing websites. If you have ever seen those ads while browsing that tell you’ve won something spectacular even though you didn’t enter a competition, clicking on the ad often leads to a phishing website where your information could be severely compromised.</p><p>It is important to note that this can happen to anyone partly due to the sophisticated ways that hackers can infiltrate a device. Thanks to spying software, the person spying on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus doesn’t even need to be a sophisticated hacker. They can be your spouse or employer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Detect-Spyware-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Detect Spyware on iPhone?</h2><p>The most logical step to take when you suspect that someone is spying on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is to take steps to detect the spyware. Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4. Background Noises"></a><strong>4. Background Noises</strong></h4><p>When you hear background noises during a call that have nothing to do with location, there may be active spyware on your device. This particularly happens when the spyware is there to monitor your phone calls.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Spyware-from-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Spyware from iPhone?</h2><p>Having a Spyware app on your device can be dangerous on many levels. Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3.

Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system. Be advised however that a restore will often erase all data and contents on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device so be sure to have a backup handy before doing this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074748849333.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Restore your Device"                ></p><p>Considering how easy it is for someone to spy on you, the best thing you can do is remain vigilant. If you notice some of the signs we’ve mentioned in Part 2 above, take the necessary steps to remove the spyware. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links especially in emails from people you don’t know.</p><h2 id="How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-for-Free"><a href="#How-to-Track-a-Lost-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 6s Plus for Free?"></a>How to Track a Lost Apple iPhone 6s Plus for Free?</h2><p>A cell phone is a rather small device when compared to other things you may haul around on a daily basis such as a purse or wallet and even a bunch of keys. Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely. However, with the increase in modern mobile technology, there are several apps that can help you track your lost cell phone’s whereabouts. But you’ve already paid a premium price for your cell phone, so what you really should do is learn how to track a lost phone for free?</p><p>And if you haven’t done so already, you should also install apps whether paid or free that do more than GPS location tracking such as monitoring incoming and outgoing calls, text and multimedia messages. So if you’re wondering how to track your lost phone for free, we’ve got a few solutions that will help you do just that, and others that bring to the table a wide range of great features.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?"></a>Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?</h2><p>One of the noteworthy features of iPhones is that they tend to retain great value for many years to come hence they become a preferred choice for prying thieves. Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your Apple iPhone 6s Plus can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.</p><p>But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.</p><p>Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080421681564.jpeg"                      alt="track your lost phone for free with iCloud"                ></p><p>Step 2. Now it’s time to hit the cloud—iCloud we mean! First things first—head to &lt;<a href="http://www.iCloud.com>">www.iCloud.com&gt;</a> from any browser and login with your credentials. From the dashboard, click on Find iPhone in the second row and enter your Apple ID and password if prompted. Since you may have several Apple devices connected with the same iCloud account, click on All Devices at the top, and select the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you wish to track from the dropdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422049397.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for free-click on Find iPhone and All Devices"                ></p><p>Step 3. That’s really all there is to it! Once you select your device, you can do one of three things—play sound, activate lost mode or erase the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device to prevent compromise of information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422409247.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for frees-start to track"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?</h2><p>If you’ve misplaced your Android cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device), and locations services on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with. Here’s how to track your lost phone with Google’s ADM.</p><p>Step 1. Most latest Android phones are already equipped with the Find My Service, but if you’re missing it, you can download it from the Google Play Store. Click start, tap security, and then device administration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422869617.jpeg"                      alt="Track Lost Android Mobile Location with Google’s ADM-install Find My Service"                ></p><p>Step 2.

Enter your email and password associated with your device account, and you will be presented with a dashboard, from where you can send an audible tone to your device even if it were on silent, lock your phone or erase it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080424492002.jpeg"                      alt="Track with Google’s ADM-locate your device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Track-Mobile-Phone-via-Spyera"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Track-Mobile-Phone-via-Spyera" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Track Mobile Phone via Spyera?"></a>Part 3: How to Track Mobile Phone via Spyera?</h2><p>Sometimes however, you will want to do a lot more than track a device such as knowing if your employees are misusing your business cellular plan or your kids are sending and receiving obscene multimedia messages from different chat applications including WhatsApp. So if you’re wondering how to track a lost phone and also access these premium features, two names immediately come to mind—Spyera and mSpy.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://spyera.com/" >Spyera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an award winning software and is compatible with both Android and iOS devices.

For instance, text messages which are one of the most important components of every phone, can now be easily intercepted or spied on, courtesy some smart applications. Yes, it is a matter of minutes now to be able to spy on or intercept text messages even when not having the target device in your possession.

Well, if this is what’s playing in your mind; you are absolutely at the right place. In this article, we are going to discuss ways to intercept text messages from both iOS and Android Phones and how to know whether your text messages have been intercepted.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended android&#x2F;ios location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Virtual Location - the most trustworthy way to fake GPS on iPhone &#x2F;Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="fake GPS of mobile device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?"></a>Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?</h2><p>Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data. This feature helps when the phone is stolen. Installing mSpy on the target phone is extremely simple and involves very few steps. So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.</p><p><strong>Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones</strong></p><p>To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2.

Once the application is set up, it is going to work invisibly and the target user will never get to know that he is being monitored. The target phone will work normally and mSpy will not interfere in any of the applications installed on the target phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781234928456.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install the application"                ></p><p>Installing in Android</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781239566126.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing in Android"                ></p><p>Installing on iOS</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781241065208.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing on iOS"                ></p><p><strong>3. Start monitoring</strong></p><p>You can now start intercepting the text messages remotely from other phones. Use your account through your login credentials and get reports from the target phone pertaining to text message history, chats, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781244325874.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Start monitoring"                ></p><p>The above screen is the monitoring console through which we can see all the text messages on the target device.

While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Two-Ways-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-without-Him-Knowing"><a href="#Two-Ways-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-without-Him-Knowing" class="headerlink" title="Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend’s Apple iPhone 6s Plus without Him Knowing"></a>Two Ways to Track My Boyfriend’s Apple iPhone 6s Plus without Him Knowing</h2><p>How can I track my boyfriend’s phone? If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?"></a>Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?</h2><p>When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy"                ></p><p>1. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.</p><p>2. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.</p><p>3. Go to its Settings &gt; Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600151360.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-download from Unknown Sources"                ></p><p>4. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.</p><p>5. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.</p><p>6. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600392625.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-access its web-based dashboard"                ></p><p>Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?"></a>Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?</h2><p>As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – <a class="link"   href="https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/" >KidsGuard Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It provided a highly reliable and secure way to track a device’s location, its vital content, and so much more. Easy to download and use, KidsGuard Pro doesn’t require you to root your Android device. After installing it on the target device, you can track it from the web dashboard control panel remotely.</p><p>Since it runs in stealth mode, it allowed me to track my boyfriend’s phone without getting detected. Besides his real-time location, I was able to know his call logs, contacts, photos, social media activity, and so much more in one place. It allowed me to track my boyfriend in a trouble-free manner. You can also do the same by following these steps:</p><p>1. Firstly, visit KidsGuard Pro’s official website right <a class="link"   href="https://panel.clevguard.com/sign-up?dev_tp=android" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your new account. You need to sign-up with your email id and set up a strong password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/create-an-account-for-clevguard.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-sign up KidsGuard Pro "                ></p><p>2. Secondly, after buying the product, you need to download the KidsGuard Pro app on your target device. Please go to the My Products and Orders Management page and click “Setup Guide” to follow the instructions carefully and complete all settings on the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/click-android-setup-guide.jpg"                      alt="complete the settings"                ></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXtNaHFBoXo" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><p>3. Great! Now all you need to do is log in to your KidsGuard Pro account on their website using your account credentials. On the home page, you can access all the major information related to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device like its location, frequent callers, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/android-control-panel.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-log-in to KidsGuard Pro’s dashboard"                ></p><p>4. Furthermore, you can simply visit the desired section from the left panel to get in-depth access. For instance, by visiting the “Locations” section, you can view the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, the previously visited places, and more.</p><p>After following these instructions, I was also able to track my boyfriend without much trouble. KidsGuard Pro also provides a seamless way to track the social media activity on the target device, record calls, listen to its surroundings, etc. Furthermore, you can enable its Keylogging feature as well to get a comprehensive record of everything typed on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. By using these amazing features, I was able to track my boyfriend’s phone without getting detected.</p><p>Since KidsGuard Pro is compatible with all the leading Android and iOS devices, you can take its assistance without facing any setbacks. I used it to track my boyfriend’s phone and so can you. Nevertheless, before you proceed, make sure that you are not doing anything illegal. You should either own the phone you are tracking or inform the other person beforehand. This will prevent you from any unforeseen situation. Now when you know better, you can easily use KidsGuard Pro to track any Android or iOS device. Go ahead and give KidsGuard Pro a try and let us know about your experience in the comments below.</p><h2 id="How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-by-Phone-Number"><a href="#How-to-Track-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-by-Phone-Number" class="headerlink" title="How to Track Apple iPhone 6s Plus by Phone Number"></a>How to Track Apple iPhone 6s Plus by Phone Number</h2><p>In most cases, tracking a lost iPhone has always been made possible thanks to the presence of tracking apps, and the use of the IMEI number. However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location - change your mobile device GPS to any place in the world with just 1 click <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number"><a href="#Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?"></a>Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?</h2><p>A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 6s Plus via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 6s Plus in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 6s Plus from whoever has the phone. In this case, the application of <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be highly recommended. The mSpy program is a highly versatile program that can be used to perform various functions depending on the preferences of the user. In our case at hand, you can use this program to track your Apple iPhone 6s Plus regardless of what part of the world the phone could have been taken to or located.</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Please note that you can only track down your Apple iPhone 6s Plus using mSpy by first installing the app on your phone. Without the installation process, tracking your phone using mSpy will be close to impossible.</p><p>The following is a detailed process on how to track an iPhone by number using mSpy phone locating feature.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Purchase-the-App"><a href="#Step-1-Purchase-the-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Purchase the App"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase the App</h4><p>Your first step is to go to the <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download this program and install it on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. What you need to do is to visit the official mSpy website and purchase the services offered by the program. The price you choose will depend on your preferences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14827039596334.jpg"                      alt="Purchase the App"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Download-and-Install-the-App"><a href="#Step-2-Download-and-Install-the-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Download and Install the App"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Download and Install the App</h4><p>Once you have made the purchase, a download link will be sent to your designated email address provided in the first step.

As for the details, please refer to how to install mSpy on Android and iPhone.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Start-Monitoring"><a href="#Step-3-Start-Monitoring" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Start Monitoring"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Start Monitoring</h4><p>With each and every step followed as required, your next step will be to start monitoring the targeted phone. For you to start tracking the phone, just login into your mSpy account and access the control panel.

All of this is made possible by the presence of the detailed map displayed on the control panel. There you have it. You can now track iPhone by phone number using mSpy without the knowledge of the current holder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/12/14827039946916.jpg"                      alt="Start Monitoring"                ></p><p>Tracking a lost phone can be fun and at the same time a daunting task. The outcome or the general experience of tracking a lost phone will solely depend on the methods applied in the overall process. As we have seen in this article, though many people may argue that it is possible to track an iPhone by the number it is evident that the overall process can be problematic and in most cases, impossible.

Hence, forgetting it somewhere or having it stolen is highly likely. However, with the increase in modern mobile technology, there are several apps that can help you track your lost cell phone’s whereabouts. But you’ve already paid a premium price for your cell phone, so what you really should do is learn how to track a lost phone for free?</p><p>And if you haven’t done so already, you should also install apps whether paid or free that do more than GPS location tracking such as monitoring incoming and outgoing calls, text and multimedia messages. So if you’re wondering how to track your lost phone for free, we’ve got a few solutions that will help you do just that, and others that bring to the table a wide range of great features.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-lost-iPhone-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?"></a>Part 1: How to Track lost iPhone for Free?</h2><p>One of the noteworthy features of iPhones is that they tend to retain great value for many years to come hence they become a preferred choice for prying thieves. Further, they can be expensive for most budgets to begin with, so losing or misplacing your Apple iPhone 6s Plus can cause a fair amount of heartache. Apple provides one of the best answers to how to track iPhones for free with its exclusive iCloud.</p><p>But before we move ahead and explain how to track your lost phone for free with iCloud, we should tell you that it is limited in its cell location tracking and other features in that it will only send a message to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, lock or erase it, and not provide records of information traffic going in and out of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. Here’s how to track lost iPhones for free.</p><p>Step 1. You will first need to ensure that the Find My iPhone feature is enabled on your device. This can be easily done by first launching the settings app on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, tapping on Apple ID at the top, and then iCloud and then Find My iPhone. Lastly, tab to enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080421681564.jpeg"                      alt="track your lost phone for free with iCloud"                ></p><p>Step 2. Now it’s time to hit the cloud—iCloud we mean! First things first—head to &lt;<a href="http://www.iCloud.com>">www.iCloud.com&gt;</a> from any browser and login with your credentials. From the dashboard, click on Find iPhone in the second row and enter your Apple ID and password if prompted. Since you may have several Apple devices connected with the same iCloud account, click on All Devices at the top, and select the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you wish to track from the dropdown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422049397.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for free-click on Find iPhone and All Devices"                ></p><p>Step 3. That’s really all there is to it! Once you select your device, you can do one of three things—play sound, activate lost mode or erase the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device to prevent compromise of information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15080422409247.jpeg"                      alt="Track lost iPhone for frees-start to track"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-Lost-Android-Mobile-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?"></a>Part 2: How to Track Lost Android Mobile Location?</h2><p>If you’ve misplaced your Android cell phone, have no fear, because there are few ways to help you track its location. There are a few things to do before you can begin tracking an Android device such as have an active and connected Google account (something you already set up when you bought the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device), and locations services on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device enabled. Even though your mobile manufacturer may offer their own exclusive solution to track your phone, Google’s Find My Device (formerly Android Device Manager) is probably the most easiest and trusted way to go with. Here’s how to track your lost phone with Google’s ADM.</p><p>Step 1. Most latest Android phones are already equipped with the Find My Service, but if you’re missing it, you can download it from the Google Play Store.

If you also have the same question, then this would be the last post you’ll read. A while back, I was a little suspicious of my boyfriend’s behavior and wanted to track my boyfriend’s phone. As I did some research, I discovered that even though there are lots of spying tools out there, only a handful of them yields the desired results. I handpicked two apps to track my boyfriend and they certainly met my expectations. Therefore, I have provided a stepwise tutorial to use them right here.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?"></a>Part 1: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via mSpy?</h2><p>When I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I tried various third-party solutions. I tried <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082599886089.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone-via mSpy"                ></p><p>1. To use mSpy, you need to visit its website right <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH96F" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create your new account. Ideally, you need to follow similar steps as KidsGuard Pro’s installation to use mSpy.</p><p>2. After creating your mSpy account and getting a paid subscription, you need to access the target device.</p><p>3. Go to its Settings &gt; Security and make sure that the option of downloading from Unknown Sources is turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600151360.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-download from Unknown Sources"                ></p><p>4. Afterward, you can go to its website and download the app.</p><p>5. Install and perform the setup of the app with your own account credentials.</p><p>6. Once it is done, you can access its web-based dashboard remotely and gain all the needed information related to the target device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15082600392625.jpg"                      alt="track my boyfriend’s phone via mSpy-access its web-based dashboard"                ></p><p>Even though mSpy provides similar features to that of KidsGuard Pro, it only works on rooted (and jailbroken) devices. Additionally, it is comparatively more expensive than KidsGuard Pro and doesn’t truly have a full-invisible mode. Any smart user can detect the spying app, which might land you in trouble.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-My-Boyfriend’s-Phone-via-KidsGuard-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?"></a>Part 2: How to Track My Boyfriend’s Phone via KidsGuard Pro?</h2><p>As I wanted to learn how can I track my boyfriend’s phone, I stumbled upon an amazing tool – <a class="link"   href="https://www.clevguard.com/android-parental-control/" >KidsGuard Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Once you are certain there is spyware on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, you are in a position to do something about it. The problem is, detecting spyware can be next to impossible because such software is designed to remain undetectable. But there are several signs that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is compromised. The following are just some of the signs to look out for.</p><h4 id="1-Data-Usage-Spikes"><a href="#1-Data-Usage-Spikes" class="headerlink" title="1. Data Usage Spikes"></a><strong>1. Data Usage Spikes</strong></h4><p>Most spyware will use up your data to work. That’s because they have to receive the information every time you send a message or make a call. Therefore, one of the ways to check for spy activity on your device is to monitor data usage. If it’s above what you would normally use, you may have spyware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074739266945.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via Data Usage Spikes"                ></p><h4 id="2-The-Cydia-App"><a href="#2-The-Cydia-App" class="headerlink" title="2. The Cydia App"></a><strong>2. The Cydia App</strong></h4><p>The presence of the Cydia app on your device when you didn’t perform a jailbreak is another indicator of spyware. Do a Spotlight search for “Cydia” to see if you find it. But the Cydia app can be very difficult to detect because sometimes it can be hidden. To eliminate the possibility, enter “4433*29342” into the spotlight search.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074740091683.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-via the Cydia App"                ></p><h4 id="3-A-warm-iPhone"><a href="#3-A-warm-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. A warm iPhone"></a><strong>3. A warm iPhone</strong></h4><p>Do you notice that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is warm even when you are not using it? If this happens, it is very likely that there is an app running in the background. Most spyware apps are designed to run in the background so this is a big indicator of spy activity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079738897604.jpg"                      alt="Detect Spyware on iPhone-notice that your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is warm"                ></p><h4 id="4-Background-Noises"><a href="#4-Background-Noises" class="headerlink" title="4.

Not only is the person spying on you violating your privacy, but they are also capable of getting vital information from your device like your address or bank information. Therefore, it is imperative that you take steps to remove the spyware o your device as soon as possible. The following are just some of the things you can do.</p><h4 id="1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program"><a href="#1-Install-Anti-Spyware-Program" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Anti-Spyware Program"></a><strong>1. Install Anti-Spyware Program</strong></h4><p>The best thing you can do is to install anti-spyware software on your device. These anti-spyware programs work by scanning the iPhone for spyware and deleting the programs. There are many such programs available but we advise to choose one with a reputation for efficiency. Anti-Spyware software will detect the spyware and ask you to uninstall it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15079737644580.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Install Anti-Spyware Program"                ></p><h4 id="2-Update-your-iOS"><a href="#2-Update-your-iOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Update your iOS"></a><strong>2. Update your iOS</strong></h4><p>Another great way to get rid of spyware is to update your iOS. This is particularly helpful when you notice the Cydia app on your device and you didn’t jailbreak it. An update is effective because it often comes with bug fixes that may eliminate the spyware from your system.</p><p>To do it go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update and tap “Download and Install.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15074749074576.jpg"                      alt="Remove Spyware from iPhone-Update your iOS"                ></p><h4 id="3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Restore your Device"></a><strong>3. Restore your Device</strong></h4><p>Restoring your Apple iPhone 6s Plus in iTunes can also be quite effective in getting rid of spyware. Like an update, a restore often eliminates the spyware by deleting all bugs affecting the system.

But apart from that, this piece of information actually serves a bigger purpose. Google, in particular, employs location data to provide high-quality services tailored to specific preferences and necessities of the users. Each Google product relies heavily on location information and utilizes it for various reasons. To understand it better, check out the list below.</p><h3 id="It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-an-essential-component-of-most-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is an essential component of most Google services"></a>It is an essential component of most Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-1.JPG"                      alt="google products"                ></p><p>Of course, Google Maps and Weather will not work without access to location data. It is the main component that allows this kind of application to function exactly as it should. That’s why you should think twice before you turn off Google location tracking. Keep it activated on your mobile device if you’re in need of real-time weather updates or reliable coordinates.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements"><a href="#It-is-used-for-targeted-advertisements" class="headerlink" title="It is used for targeted advertisements"></a>It is used for targeted advertisements</h3><p>The majority of online advertisements scattered all over the internet are run by Google. It uses location data to ensure the ads that appear on your web browser are relevant to your personal liking. For example, Google Ads will likely flash American products on your smartphones if you’re located in that particular region. Do you want to keep it that way? If so, you should not then turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-provide-accurate-search-results" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to provide accurate search results"></a>It is used by Google to provide accurate search results</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-2.JPG"                      alt="google search results"                ></p><p>The same thing goes for Google search results. This query engine uses location data to provide information relevant to the specific needs of the user. Let’s say you’re currently residing in Japan and looking for nearby coffee shops. Of course, it will be unhelpful if Google dispenses a list of coffee shops that aren’t located in your country. That’s why you shouldn’t turn off Google location tracking on your smartphone if you’re looking for precise and pertinent answers.</p><h3 id="It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols"><a href="#It-is-used-by-Google-to-implement-certain-security-protocols" class="headerlink" title="It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols"></a>It is used by Google to implement certain security protocols</h3><p>Google uses location data to keep your accounts safe from potential attacks and security breaches.

Another thing is that strange activities on your account are promptly detected with the aid of location information. Simply put, allowing Google to access your whereabouts is the least you can do to protect your digital assets. Hence, don’t turn off Google location tracking on your Android smartphone if you need such assistance.</p><h3 id="It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services"><a href="#It-is-utilized-for-research-and-further-improvements-of-Google-services" class="headerlink" title="It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services"></a>It is utilized for research and further improvements of Google services</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/turn-off-google-location-tracking-3.JPG"                      alt="google services"                ></p><p>We all know that Google is committed to offering us new products and improving its existing services.

However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location - change your mobile device GPS to any place in the world with just 1 click <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number"><a href="#Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?"></a>Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?</h2><p>A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 6s Plus via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 6s Plus in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 6s Plus from whoever has the phone.

It works by connecting our car with the mobile phone and allowing us to know at all times the location of our car, something very useful in case of missing or even theft. In addition, in case of an accident, we can notify the emergency services through the same application.</p><p>This app to find your car consists of a sensor connected to the mobile application and all we have to do is install it in the OBD (On Board Diagnostics) port of our vehicle, usually located next to the instrument control or around of the center console. It is available for iOS. Apart from looking for the car, this app allows us to control through Bluetooth also the consumption of gasoline, the effort that has made the engine, if you suffer and how to avoid it while advising us on how to achieve and maintain optimal driving.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>Can receive free emergency help in case of a crash.</p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Available in English.</p><p>Compatible with iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch</p><p>Control if you need gasoline through Bluetooth</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723208344.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Automatic"                ></p><p>URL:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8" >https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/automatic-classic/id596594365?mt=8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version"><a href="#Option-4-Google-Maps-It-will-be-available-in-the-next-version" class="headerlink" title="Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)"></a>Option 4: Google Maps (It will be available in the next version)</h2><p>Introduction: This application is implementing new features for drivers to find parking more easily. It tries to help those forgetful drivers who park but then do not know where they parked the vehicle. For them, Maps is responsible for collecting information on the time in which they have been stopped after moving by car, if we have the mobile connected to the car by Bluetooth, the application understands that we have been using a vehicle, and shows the parking with a round blue icon with a capital P inside. If this does not appear, it can also be saved in another way. Once parked you can open the map of the application and click on the blue point of location. At that time it gives us the option to Save your parking leaving the blue icon mentioned above.</p><p>The second functionality of Google Maps in developing is the option to know where we can find available parking. In addition to the information collected by the application of our travels, it is able to show the most traveled places and with or greater parking so it can inform you where you are most likely to find parking. How does it work? A small red icon with a blank P appears next to the destination that we selected in our search. Next to the letter appears a text that indicates information about the parking in that zone.</p><p>Unfortunately, these options are not yet implemented on all Android and iOS smartphones. If our mobile phone does not yet have any of these features wait for the latest update as it is expected to be available on these operating systems very soon as a car locator device.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>GPS locator for car</p><p>Shows available parking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15081723711372.jpg"                      alt="Car Locator Apps-Google Maps"                ></p><p>URL is not available yet.</p><h2 id="Option-5-Waze"><a href="#Option-5-Waze" class="headerlink" title="Option 5: Waze"></a>Option 5: Waze</h2><p>Introduction: This app, compatible with Android and iOS is intended for users who go by car.</p><p>It allows to obtain routes and check movements in real time, besides visualizing possible obstacles in your way.</p><p>The application goes beyond navigation because it permits drivers to share road reports on accidents, police checks or any other danger along their way and get information about what is coming also.

This app comes with the facility to get a notification when the target person arrives or leaves a place. Here, if you have access to the target device and the “Find my friends” option then it will give you the solution on how to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p>Step1: Enable the option “Share my location” on the target phone. To enable share my location, open the app “Find my friends” &gt; Go for the contact’s photo &gt; “Share my location”.</p><p>Step 2: Generally iCloud account has sharing options for all other devices. We have to ensure the sharing option is correctly viewed as the target device such as “This device”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100182891050.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-share my location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now swipe from bottom to end, click on the “Airdrop” option from the settings. You will have two options such as “Everyone” and “Contacts only”.</p><p>Step 4: Move to the target device, in the “Find my friends” app click the option “add”. Now your contact picture will get displayed. Click on your profile photo &gt; select the option “Share indefinitely” to track a cell phone without them knowing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183209840.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-Share indefinitely"                ></p><p>Step 5: The target device location will be shared with you. You will get a pop-up window “Accept” it. It will again ask if you want to share location so, click on “Don’t share”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/11/15100183459135.jpg"                      alt="track a cell phone without them knowing-click Don’t share"                ></p><p>Step 6: Now go to your device, open the “Find my friends” app and click the icon of the target device.

What is rooting? Does it have a warranty? Any rooting between Android and mSpy?</strong></p><p>Rooting is obviously known as the control between Android users and Android subsystems. It has a warranty period and rooting is applicable if you track WhatsApp, Facebook messages.</p><p><strong>2. How one can detect the software to monitor on an Android device?</strong></p><p>mSpy is authorized and certified software and it has to run legally on both user and the target device. If the illegal process is found, you can assist customer support immediately.</p><p><strong>3. If the phone was stolen, can I find My Apple iPhone 6s Plus using the number?</strong></p><p>mSpy activates if installed on the iPhone completely. The process of finding the phone using a number is not applicable in mSpy.</p><p>We must tell you using mSpy and FlexiSPY are both one of the best methods to track a cell phone. Both the applications have several metrics and would certainly assist in how to track a cell phone without them knowing.

For instance, text messages which are one of the most important components of every phone, can now be easily intercepted or spied on, courtesy some smart applications. Yes, it is a matter of minutes now to be able to spy on or intercept text messages even when not having the target device in your possession. Moreover, there are applications that work on all platforms whether it is android or iOS. But how do you intercept text messages? Well, if this is what’s playing in your mind; you are absolutely at the right place. In this article, we are going to discuss ways to intercept text messages from both iOS and Android Phones and how to know whether your text messages have been intercepted.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended android&#x2F;ios location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Virtual Location - the most trustworthy way to fake GPS on iPhone &#x2F;Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="fake GPS of mobile device"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-know-whether-your-text-message-has-been-intercepted" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?"></a>Part 1: How to know whether your text message has been intercepted?</h2><p>Intercepting a target phone could give us the controls and allow us to spy on various activities happening on the target phone even to the extent of giving us information about what’s happening in the surrounding. It does this by listening to the conversation by turning on the microphone even when the target phone is not in use. So, while the spying application keeps running in the background silently, text messages can be easily intercepted. So, it is imperative to know and read the signs to actually get to know if your text messages are being intercepted. There are some signs which could give you an idea if your text message has been intercepted.</p><p><strong>Odd Phone Behavior</strong> – If your phone is behaving erratic and lights up suddenly even when not in use, it is possible that the cell phone is being intercepted. Some other signs could be random beeping noise, phone shutting down by itself, etc. While this might happen normally at times, if it is happening on a regular basis, there is a chance that the phone text message or for that matter phone data is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Battery Rundown</strong> – Some spy software running in the background can consume a lot of battery charge. If there is a dramatic change in the battery consumption and the phone now needs charging more often, it might mean that text messages or the phone is being intercepted.</p><p><strong>Phone Shuts down</strong> – If your phone regularly shuts down by itself, even if the battery is fully charged, there could be one spy application running on the phone.</p><p><strong>Increased data usage</strong> – If you see a dramatic increase in the consumption of data, it could be due to the spy application running silently in the background. The spy applications constantly send the recorded text message logs and data from the target phone which increases data consumption.</p><p>So, these are some signs which could suggest that your text message has been intercepted.</p><p>Intercepting text messages is now very easy using a robust application which can intercept any device in some simple steps. Moreover, the application can be used with both iOS and Android devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones"><a href="#Part-2-Intercepting-text-messages-from-both-iOS-and-Android-phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones"></a>Part 2: Intercepting text messages from both iOS and Android phones</h2><p><strong>mSpy:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular application that is compatible with both iPhone and Android. mSpy for the phone has all the features which make this application a unique one to go for. mSpy for phones could give information regarding text messages on the target device and chats. Moreover, mSpy also gives information about call logs and contacts along with access to the IM chats like WhatsApp monitoring, Snapchat monitoring, etc. mSpy also allows you to view the photos and videos taken or stored or just viewed on the target device. mSpy can remotely erase the targeted phone’s data. This feature helps when the phone is stolen. Installing mSpy on the target phone is extremely simple and involves very few steps. So, it takes a few minutes to install the application on the target phone. mSpy works with iPhone as well as Android phones. So, text message interception is possible with both iPhone and Android using mSpy.</p><p><strong>Using mSpy to intercept text messages from other phones</strong></p><p>To be able to intercept text messages from other phones, it is first required to install the mSpy application on the target phone that has to be intercepted. Here are some steps to intercept text messages using mSpy from other phones:</p><p><strong>1. Install mSpy and set it up</strong></p><p>To start the process, buy mSpy that has to be installed on the target device. mSpy requires account creation and activation. This account with login credentials will be later used to monitor all the activities. You will be asked for an email id in which you will receive the setup procedure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781232495235.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install mSpy and set it up"                ></p><p><strong>2. Install the application</strong></p><p>After you have received the installation procedures, install <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the target device which will take a few minutes. Once the application is set up, it is going to work invisibly and the target user will never get to know that he is being monitored. The target phone will work normally and mSpy will not interfere in any of the applications installed on the target phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781234928456.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Install the application"                ></p><p>Installing in Android</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781239566126.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing in Android"                ></p><p>Installing on iOS</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781241065208.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Installing on iOS"                ></p><p><strong>3. Start monitoring</strong></p><p>You can now start intercepting the text messages remotely from other phones. Use your account through your login credentials and get reports from the target phone pertaining to text message history, chats, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/11/14781244325874.jpg"                      alt="intercept text messages-Start monitoring"                ></p><p>The above screen is the monitoring console through which we can see all the text messages on the target device. The control panel can be opened on any device i.e. phone or computer through the browser using the login credentials.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-you-need-to-know-when-using-mSpy"><a href="#Part-3-What-you-need-to-know-when-using-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What you need to know when using mSpy"></a>Part 3: What you need to know when using mSpy</h2><p><strong>Few things to know when using <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</strong></p><p>While the working, installation, and setting up of mSpy is very easy, there are a few things that need to be kept in mind while using mSpy.</p><p>1. While it is possible to remotely access data, monitor, and control the target device, it is imperative to have physical access to the target device to install the application, grant permissions, and set the application up. This is a one-time task that needs to be done before you start accessing the target device records remotely from other devices using the browser.</p><p>2. If the target device is iPhone or iPad, the target device must be jailbroken for mSpy to be used.</p><p>3. The target device must be connected to the internet. mSpy will constantly send information pertaining to text messages or SMS, call logs, WhatsApp messages, etc from the target device to the control panel while it is connected to the internet.</p><p>So, these are the ways to install and start intercepting text messages both for iOS and Android using mSpy and we also listed down a few things that have to be kept in mind while going for mSpy. Hope this helps you in successfully and safely intercepting text messages.</p><h2 id="2-Ways-to-Monitor-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Activity"><a href="#2-Ways-to-Monitor-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Activity" class="headerlink" title="2 Ways to Monitor Apple iPhone 6s Plus Activity"></a>2 Ways to Monitor Apple iPhone 6s Plus Activity</h2><p>Your child’s security is priceless, and we understand that.

However, in the past few years, it has always been in the public domain and in the minds of many technocrats about the possibility of tracking an iPhone by only using its phone number (cellular number). Regardless of what has been said, tracking an iPhone using its number alone is a process that requires an in-depth understanding and application. In this article, we are going to take a look at the possibility of how to track an iPhone by phone number, as well as the use of the mSpy program to track a lost iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Recommended location faker tool: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location - change your mobile device GPS to any place in the world with just 1 click <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</strong></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number"><a href="#Part-1-Is-It-Possible-to-Track-An-iPhone-with-Just-the-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?"></a>Part 1: Is It Possible to Track An iPhone with Just the Number?</h2><p>A lot of people have always asked me; is it possible to track my iPhone by phone number? Well; regardless of what people say out there, it is usually close to impossible to track your lost iPhone by primarily using only its phone number. In this case, the phone number in question is the number provided to you by your cellular provider. The moment you lose your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, the chances of the thief changing your SIM card to another SIM card are high. This obviously makes it impossible to track your Apple iPhone 6s Plus via a number that is no longer available. However, there’s a leeway on how to track an iPhone by phone number though it depends on sheer chances and lack.</p><p>You can only track iPhone by phone number only if the culprit with the phone doesn’t change the SIM card. This is a sheer lack of procedure when you consider the fact that people nowadays steal phones and change the Sim cards as well as the IMEI numbers. If you want to track your Apple iPhone 6s Plus in such cases, your only option would be to contact your cellular provider and ask them to perform a phone triangulation procedure or tell you if any calls were made using your number. Regardless of the type of iPhone tracking services, you might decide to use; the fact still remains that they can’t track your lost iPhone using the phone number. So don’t be duped by these companies or apps that claim to track your lost phone by using the phone number. What they can only do for you is to tell you the last position where the phone was detected, or if any calls were made and to whom. Basically, for you to trace your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, you need its IMEI number, but not the phone number.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Track-iPhone-Online-via-mSpy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy"></a>Part 2: How to Track iPhone Online via mSpy</h2><p>Since it is impossible to track iPhone via the phone number, you can employ the use of secondary software and apps to track and primarily retrieve your Apple iPhone 6s Plus from whoever has the phone. In this case, the application of <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would be highly recommended. The mSpy program is a highly versatile program that can be used to perform various functions depending on the preferences of the user. In our case at hand, you can use this program to track your Apple iPhone 6s Plus regardless of what part of the world the phone could have been taken to or located.</p><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Please note that you can only track down your Apple iPhone 6s Plus using mSpy by first installing the app on your phone. Without the installation process, tracking your phone using mSpy will be close to impossible.</p><p>The following is a detailed process on how to track an iPhone by number using mSpy phone locating feature.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Purchase-the-App"><a href="#Step-1-Purchase-the-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Purchase the App"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase the App</h4><p>Your first step is to go to the <a class="link"   href="http://mspy.go2cloud.org/SH7G6" >mSpy official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download this program and install it on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus.

The outcome or the general experience of tracking a lost phone will solely depend on the methods applied in the overall process. As we have seen in this article, though many people may argue that it is possible to track an iPhone by the number it is evident that the overall process can be problematic and in most cases, impossible. The only way out of tracking and finding your phone is by using the IMEI number. Any other number used for iPhone tracking purposes will only be for gathering information for investigative reasons.</p><h2 id="Top-9-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Monitoring-Apps-for-Parental-Controls"><a href="#Top-9-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-Monitoring-Apps-for-Parental-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Top 9 Apple iPhone 6s Plus Monitoring Apps for Parental Controls"></a>Top 9 Apple iPhone 6s Plus Monitoring Apps for Parental Controls</h2><p>The iPhone monitoring apps to control the phone of the children proliferate in these times of Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook.
